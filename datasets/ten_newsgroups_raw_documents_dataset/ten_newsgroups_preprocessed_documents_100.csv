business_0,"Lufthansa flies back to profit Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003. In a preliminary report, Lufthansa announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; £274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. Lufthansa was also hit by troubles at Lufthansa's US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. Lufthansa said that Lufthansa will give all the details of Lufthansa's 2004 results on 23 March.",business
business_1,"Japanese growth grinds to a halt Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough. Output in the three months to September grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion. an economy not long out of a decade-long trough had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept Japanese shoppers from spending. The effect was to leave an economy not long out of a decade-long trough more dependent than ever on exports for an economy not long out of a decade-long trough's recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive. The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. ""Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,"" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. ""Personal consumption looks good, but Personal consumption was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. ""The amber light is flashing."" The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy The government will have to implement when an economy not long out of a decade-long trough picks up to help deal with Japan's massive public debt.",business

WorldCom had been overstating WorldCom's accounts by $11bn (£8.5bn). The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following his former boss Bernard Ebbers's trial, where The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom is appearing as a prosecution witness. his former boss Bernard Ebbers has always insisted that his former boss Bernard Ebbers was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances.

business_4,"Peugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi Mitsubishi has struck a deal to supply Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV). The two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say The two firms expect to seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. a Memorandum of Understanding comes as a badly-needed boost for Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV) will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives Mitsubishi a chance to utilise some of underused capacity. In January, Mitsubishi issued Mitsubishi's third profits warning in nine months, and cut Mitsubishi's sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that Mitsubishi had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, Mitsubishi has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month Mitsubishi said Mitsubishi was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down Last month to shoulder responsibility for Mitsubishi's troubles. Mitsubishi has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in Mitsubishi's current financial year to March 2005.

business_5,"US adds more jobs than expected The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations. In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of The US economy except manufacturing. While the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, this was because more people were now actively seeking work. The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. In addition, Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. the Labor Department figures had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. ""It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,"" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons. Other analysts said the Labor Department figures made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when the US Federal Reserve meets next week. ""the Labor Department figures should empower the US Federal Reserve to clearly do something,"" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of Labor Department, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned investors's attention to other economic factors, such as the US's record trade deficit. There is also speculation that newly re-elected President George W Bush will deliberately try to keep The dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.",business

Winn-Dixie said bankruptcy protection would enable Winn-Dixie to successfully restructure. Winn-Dixie said Winn-Dixie's 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said Winn-Dixie would most likely off-load a number of sites. Winn-Dixie has total debts of $1.87bn (£980m). In Winn-Dixie's bankruptcy petition Winn-Dixie listed Winn-Dixie's biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which Winn-Dixie owes $15.1m. Analysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie's slide into bankruptcy was widely expected.

business_10,"Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has GM's announcement that General Motors, the world's largest car maker, will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s loss-making Saab factory in Sweden. The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s efforts to make a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS appeal to European drivers, a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine. General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden has been at the centre of rumours about General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s planned severe cutbacks in General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s troubled European operations. But General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s new commitment to its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden may not be welcomed by General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany may now have to face a larger proportion of General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s cuts. Neither will GM's announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since GM's announcement reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said Saab is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. the lucrative European luxury car market's leaders do not agree. General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s plans to build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS in Sweden is part of General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s efforts to push a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes and BMW have retained German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW's stranglehold on the lucrative European luxury car market. Bringing a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. fewer than 130,000 cars per year is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s European operations, General Motors, the world's largest car maker, is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saab to the US, a market where drivers have adopted Saab as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saab more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. ""a leading European car maker know that in five years the weak US dollar will be stronger than the weak US dollar is today,"" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was ""stupid"", the chief executive of a leading European car maker said. In a separate announcement, General Motors, the world's largest car maker, unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s Opel and Vauxhall models. a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models follows a similar initiative by General Motors, the world's largest car maker, in the US. General Motors, the world's largest car maker, said General Motors, the world's largest car maker, wanted to change ""customers''s perceptions"" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing customers' that the quality had improved in recent years.",business

business_14,"China keeps tight rein on credit China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by The curbs down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report. The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, China has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a ""hard landing"" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of China's peg. To some extent, The curbs do seem to be taking effect.

The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. bankruptcy followed MCI's admission in 2002 that MCI illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Shareholders lost about $180bn when MCI collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost 20,000 workers's jobs. Former previous name WorldCom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has Qwest come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that Qwest manipulated Qwest's results to keep Wall Street happy. MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after former long-distance giant AT&T Consolidation in The US telecoms market has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.

business_19,"Brewers' profits lose Brewers' profits's fizz Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the world's's largest brewers, have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat. Heineken saw Heineken's annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in the year may also slide. Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the world's largest brewers, are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature. Heineken's net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; £371m) during the year, from 798m euro a year ago. Heineken blamed weak demand in western Europe and currency losses. Heineken had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off Heineken's operating profits. Despite the dip in profits, Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said Heineken now plans to invest 100m euros in ""aggressive"" and ""high-impact"" marketing in Europe and the US in the year. Heineken said Heineken would also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries. Heineken increased Heineken's dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in the year net profit. Carlsberg, the world's's fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Carlsberg's beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries. Nevertheless, total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about the year, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. However, Carlsberg also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, imported brands. ""investment bank Merrill Lynch remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, social and structural reasons,"" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg.",business

At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery. Analysts, however, pointed to Dollar's inability recently to extend something of a recovery despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the US's's economic problems had not disappeared.

business_23,"India and Russia in energy talks India and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part of a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects. On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India's ONGC. India's ONGC is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos. India's ONGC is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft. Russian media reported that India and Russia signed a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Russian energy giant Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India's petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar. a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects is likely to see India and Russia develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia. India's ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea. India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year. India's ONGC's Mr Raha said India and Russia could work together on joint bids from next year. ""At current oil and gas prices, India's ONGC's cash flow situation is good,"" Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha told Reuters. ""What India's ONGC are saying is - Russian energy giant Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and India's ONGC have the money. ""The investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so."" Russian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of oil unit Yuganskneftegas at a meeting on Tuesday. India's ONGC's Mr Raha declined to be drawn on Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha's firm's reported interest in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. However, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha stressed that India's ONGC was not interested in a 'loan-for-oil deal' in connection to oil unit Yuganskneftegas, similar to that concluded recently between state-owned energy giant Rosneft and China's's National Petroleum Corporation.

business_24,"Weak data buffets French economy A batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over French economy's future prospects. Official figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in last month. At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth. ""[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,"" finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy said. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand. Analysts said French companies, keen to protect French companies's profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. ""[Official figures] show the main problem of French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,"" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. ""Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late."" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects French economy to grow by about 2.4% the year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. about 2.4% is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.",business
business_25,"Business fears over sluggish EU economy As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business. Lille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of France at the weekend. But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, and consider that the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like northern England and industrial Scotland, coal, steel and textiles have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille. Beck-Crespel has not laid off a worker since 1945. Beck-Crespel specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry are being built in Europe these days. Director Hugues Charbonnier says Director Hugues Charbonnier is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of Director Hugues Charbonnier's output more cheaply, while Director Hugues Charbonnier's key markets are now in China and India. ""In Beck-Crespel's business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with Beck-Crespel's size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union, (if Beck-Crespel did that) Beck-Crespel would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,"" Director Hugues Charbonnier says. It isn't just globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though workers work just 35 hours. But at least there is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference. That is one reason why people here are not great fans of EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille. ""In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas the unemployment rate is 15%. people here don't see what Europe is doing for people here, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,"" Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille says. Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from euro it is here. euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. Much of trade passes through the world's largest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec. specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec's cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec's main customers are closer. Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. ""In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in EU it is more or less 1%,"" Boss Henk Addink says. Boss Henk Addink blames euro for stifling demand. Boss Henk Addink much preferred the old currencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country's economic performance. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In Britain this year would be a bad year; in Germany this year is one of the best in recent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem. If Germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across Europe is never going to be as strong as growth across the bloc could be. However, at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing. The Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after Siemens threatened to take one factory near the Dutch border and Staff's jobs to Hungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that Factory manager Herbert Stueker now hopes to increase productivity ""by nearly 30%"". But Germany needs much more reform if all Germany's industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. ""Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we could solve the main problem we could cut unemployment by half,"" Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University says. EU set EU the target of that process the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. Four years into that process, and the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010 seems further away than ever.",business

The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of its struggling car business, with Herbert Demel leaving its struggling car business. The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years. Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales. its struggling car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its struggling car business's break-even target from 2005 to 2006. The management changes are part of a wider shake-up of its struggling car business following Fiat's resolution of Fiat's dispute with General Motors. As part of a major restructuring, Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently owned by Ferrari - within Fiat's own operations. Ferrari, in which Fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about £10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said The Treasury's plans were on track and funded until 2008. According to The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), if UK's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is ""unlikely"" golden rule will be met. Should the government's current economic cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to ""50/50"". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said. a report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. accountancy firm Ernst & Young the latest claims revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A The Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying The Treasury was ""on track to meeting spending rules and golden rule in the government's current economic cycle and beyond"". ""Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and Spending plans are fully affordable."" Other than a report's warning on possible tax hikes, the The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy. a report said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the ""world economy will continue to grow strongly"". Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan.

business_29,"Call centre users 'lose patience' Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests. Once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. ""Customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society,"" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned a survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick customers's way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using more customers's mobile phones. The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks. ""Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now a call centre's agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,"" Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, a survey found. In what IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey calls an ""alarming development"", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving ""agents not equipped to deal with customers"". This, Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey warns, is ""scary"" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high ""churn rate"", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but about 70% is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate. Suggestions that ""outsourcing"" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says. There are ""no big differences in wait time and call resolution"" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. ""You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,"" Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says. However, companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for a survey have no plans to the move Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey's call centres. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey give three key reasons for not making the move: - call centre operations are part of Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey's business ""core function"", - Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey are worried about the risk of going abroad, - Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey fear that Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey will damage Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey's brand if Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey join the offshoring drive. a survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents.

""The strong growth outlook for its Sandoz unit, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,"" Novartis said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to Generic drugs's more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as its Sandoz unit can copy their more expensive branded rivals usually after Producers such as Sandoz's patent protection expires and can sell their more expensive branded rivals more cheaply as Producers such as Sandoz do not have to pay research and development cost. There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that analysts call fragmented. However, not all analysts were initially convinced about The deal. ""The deal is a very expensive acquisition,"" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters. ""Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, find it strange that Novartis are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where Novartis suffered price pressure.""",business
business_31,"Economy 'strong' in election year UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. Optimism is at Optimism's highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but rates could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO Stoy Hayward optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead The rise up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. The only thing blighting business optimism the year will be uncertainties associated with the anticipated general election in May, BDO Stoy Hayward said. BDO Stoy Hayward's BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, BDO Stoy Hayward noted. BDO Stoy Hayward's inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October. ""The UK is looking strong going into the anticipated general election in May, but businesses need to prepare businesses for a jolt ahead as The Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. ""Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.""",business

The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. ""There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand,"" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in a statement. ""But growth of 0.1% in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the job market."" High oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect, Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency said. The brunt of German unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where the rate is 18.8%. With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked anger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, notably among Germany's iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called ""one-euro jobs"" which top up unemployment benefit.

A survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said employer contributions had a rise of 49.7% from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%. Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised Companies facing the biggest deficits's pension contributions by 100% or more, Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said. Many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased liabilities. A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when the scheme member retire. The rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes. money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes are less risky for employers. Under money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes, employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement. Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said there were some schemes in good health. But, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle ""yawning deficits"". The level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. In 1998/99, for example, contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. In contrast, between 1996 and 1998, some employers cut some employers's contribution levels. Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in contributions was ""staggering"" and the highest ever recorded by Incomes Data Services' (IDS). ""the IDS Pensions Service have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision,"" said Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service,. ""With figures like the rise in contributions there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in final salary schemes.""",business

business_38,"Market unfazed by Aurora setback As Aurora limped back to Aurora's dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. Aurora had another slice of bad luck to add to Aurora's history of health scares and technical trouble. And Aurora's owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped one of the world's biggest investment banks's target for the huge US Carnival Corporation's share price, from £35 to £36.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT the huge US Carnival Corporation's shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at £32.26. Why the mismatch between the public perception and Market's response? ""The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion. ""The Aurora issue was clearly a source of uncertainty for the huge US Carnival Corporation - The Aurora issue was a long cruise, after all. But Market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events."" Despite Aurora's string of bad luck, Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large the huge US Carnival Corporation fleet, the UK's's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, the huge US Carnival Corporation has a reputation for keeping the huge US Carnival Corporation's ships pretty much on schedule. ""the huge US Carnival Corporation has an incredibly strong track record,"" Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion. Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for the huge US Carnival Corporation and the huge US Carnival Corporation's main competitor, Royal Caribbean. ""While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,"" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. ""Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises."" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK's - but for the huge US Carnival Corporation customers elsewhere The Aurora issue's unlikely to make too much of a splash. Assuming that Citigroup Smith Barney is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in the huge US Carnival Corporation's favour. In the wake of the UK's P&O Princess group's takeover by the huge US Carnival Corporation, the huge US Carnival Corporation is now to a great extent a duopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, ""slowing supply growth"" is a certainty, said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. And with the huge US Carnival Corporation remaining the market leader, the huge US Carnival Corporation looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to Aurora in the future.",business

The affected vehicles in the largest recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. The affected vehicles in the product recall are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, GM is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that GM did not know of any injuries related to the problems.

Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value. However, Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa's losses were much smaller, reflecting the market's view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs.

London Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, US light crude traded in New York's lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has The falls 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) The news on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. ""It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,"" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed The falls to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil. The stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto nine-month highs by the end of Thursday. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The falls helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that The falls could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world. The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. the energy minister of Opec member Algeria said Opec member Algeria was likely to keep output unchanged when Opec member Algeria meets next week. However, some analysts believe The falls may harden Opec member Algeria's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output. Fears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in North America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.

business_43,"Markets fall on weak dollar fears Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan. The London FTSE fell 0.8% while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, Tokyo's Nikkei 225's steepest fall in three months. G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And Fed chief Alan Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit. On Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the sinking dollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of Monday. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional ""strong dollar"" policy. The latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across the US's public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the sinking dollar lower. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the traditional ""strong dollar"" policy remained unaltered. But US Treasury Secretary John Snow also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the sinking dollar. Some had looked to a finance ministers' meeting for direction. But US Treasury Secretary John Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda. For the US, letting the sinking dollar drift is a useful short-term fix. US exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close a $500bn trade gap. In the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the debt to $8.2 trillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the sinking dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US spends and what the US earns. But already the US are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. And Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the sinking dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. ""It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,"" Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said.",business

The optimism in the financial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the Japanese business community. Earlier this month, the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese manufacturers found that business confidence had the fall in confidence for the first time since March 2003. Slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall in confidence. Despite this, traders expect strength in the global economy to benefit Japan. Structural reform within Japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector's bad debt problems should also help, traders say.",business
business_48,"Iraqi voters turn to economic issues Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters. A vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. So there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. ""First rule of law, then an economy in tatters,"" says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003. Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's view about what an elected government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis. an economy in tatters has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in Iraq. Job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi people's wish list. Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. ""Estimates of Iraq's unemployment rate vary, but the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution estimate Iraq's unemployment rate to be between 30-40%,"" the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution's Iraq Index. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to Iraq's oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003. Iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. But serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. One Iraqi woman told Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq about One Iraqi woman's frustration as One Iraqi woman watched TV adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from Baghdad's's pharmacies. Observes Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003: ""an economy in tatters at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."" An indication of marks can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking principles. Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into finance. National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq. Foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. Bechtel's's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting Bechtel's's bottom line while Halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to Iraq taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq. ""the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond is seen as a selling off of Iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,"" Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq says. Consequently, an elected government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over an elected government's proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq explains. In the West, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the majority of Iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. Opinion polls suggest that ""people still want Iraq to take a leading role in providing job creation, social security and healthcare"", Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq says. Yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left Iraq three decades ago. ""Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 says. ""Iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth."" Many foreign companies say Many foreign companies are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering Iraq in any meaningful way. But there are exceptions. Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 across Iraq in Kirkuk and Baghdad's, and Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 points out.

business_49,"China continues breakneck growth China's economy has The news by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%. The news may mean more limits on investment and lending as China tries to take China's economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed China's expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if China overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year. Still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - China's first hike in nine years - in October 2004. Despite the apparent rebalancing of China's economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. ""There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,"" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings. China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China's currency. China keeps the yuan, China's currency pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist officials are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. ""We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,"" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. ""Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.""",business
business_50,"Japan's's ageing workforce: built to last In his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. And the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's life. the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune is one of Japan's's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. At the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's neat Osaka detached house, where the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune lives with one of the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's sexagenarian daughters, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Between tasks, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune reveals what the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's next goal is: ""Well, what's most important for the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune is to be Japan's's number one."" the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, Japan's, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to this phenomenon until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and Europeans. On the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu's younger friends, who are in his younger friends, who are in their seventies's seventies. ""83-year-old Yuji Shimizu think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,"" 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu remarks. ""On average, we can live longer."" Whether it's the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, Japan's's elderly are remarkable. But while life may be a game of golf for 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu's grandchildren have huge problems ahead. Japan's is the world's's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US. By 2007, Japan's's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. This means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled. ""In the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,"" explains Shigeo Morioka of the International Longevity Centre in Tokyo. So how will Japan's's finances stay on track? After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of Japan's's gross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised countries. The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan's's welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. But unfortunately, Japan's appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan, asks; ""Who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker? ""Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?"" One option is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from the Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff. Standing next to Tokyo harbour is a version of New York's Statue of Liberty. But, as yet, Japan's is not ready for an Ellis Island. ""Japan's has never really liked that option in Japan's's history and Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan think that option's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,"" insists Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan. In Japan's, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. But for the economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash. Of course the Japanese could always have more children. The government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until 2030, when today's babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, starts to unfold in 2010. In contrast to Japan's - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. Although President Bush must re-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in the US's over 65s, The International Monetary Fund foresees a positive contribution to the US current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration. Some voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the Japanese labour market. Some voices in Japanese industry want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over Japan's's ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. ""Japan's still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting Japan's's auto business or Japan's's semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,"" says Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan. Japan's can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. Falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. Come 2020, Japan's could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. There are fears that the world's's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. But none of fears that the world's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession is the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's concern anymore. At 101, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune chuckles that, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune feels fine.",business

Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",business

A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years. Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. ""The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,"" the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors housing spokesman Ian Perry said. ""The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate."" The figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the market. On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December.

business_64,"Battered dollar hits Thursday's new low for the dollar Battered dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy. Battered dollar hit $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to $1.3509. Battered dollar has weakened sharply since September when Battered dollar traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits. Meanwhile, France's finance minister has said the world faced ""economic catastrophe"" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls. France's finance minister said France's finance minister would seek action on currency controls at the next meeting of G7 countries in February. Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen Battered dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt Ministers from European and Asian governments's export-driven economies. ""It's absolutely essential that at the meeting of G7 countries our American friends understand that our American friends need coordinated management at the world level,"" said France's finance minister. Thursday's's new low for Battered dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity. Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% November. just 0.2% was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The official US policy is that the US supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe the US is happy to let Battered dollar fall because of the boost to the US's exporters. the US has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated Battered dollar still has further to fall from ""abnormal and dangerous heights"" set in 2002. the US says the US will let market forces determine Battered dollar's strength rather than intervene directly. Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting President Bush's aim to cut the US trade and budget deficits have prompted slight upturns in Battered dollar. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday's had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. Battered dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. ""Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London can see Battered dollar finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it's going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, finishing the year around $1.40,"" said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London.",business
business_65,"Disaster claims 'less than $10bn' Insurers have sought to calm fears that Insurers face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern Asia. Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said. Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (£5.17bn). Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, believes that the cost would be substantial but that the cost is unlikely to be in double-digit billions, the Financial Times reported. Munich Re, the world's's largest reinsurance company, said that Munich Re's exposure is less than 100m euros (£70m; $136m). At least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand among the worst hit. southern Asia's resorts and Western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants. Lloyds of London told the Financial Times Lloyds of London expected Lloyds of London's exposure to be limited to ""holiday resorts, personal accident, travel insurance and marine risks"". A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, has paid out about 300 million euros (£281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the US. But insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through. ""So many things are unclear, it is just too early to tell,"" said Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers,'s natural disasters department. ""You need very complicated processes to estimate damages. Unlike four major hurricanes in the US, you can't just run a model."" Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re's natural disasters department anticipated that Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re's natural disasters department's own company's total claims would be less then those from four major hurricanes in the US, which Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, put at $640m. Allianz, a leading German insurer, said Allianz, a leading German insurer, did not know yet what Allianz, a leading German insurer,'s exposure would be. However, Allianz, a leading German insurer, said giant waves were unlikely to have a ""significant"" impact on Allianz, a leading German insurer,'s business. Zurich Financial said Zurich Financial could not yet assess the cost of an earthquake. The impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said. Most US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. Insured damage could be a fraction of the ""billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands and Malaysia,"" said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb. ""US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. It's more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure,"" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co. Many of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldive Islands, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch. Hurricane Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. But the cost of an earthquake and giant waves on the individuals involved is incalculable. ""We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages  that have just been wiped out. Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,"" said Jan Egeland, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Tourists cutting short Tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas's holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too. The Association of British insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. The Association of British insurers said loss of possessions will usually be covered, but The Association of British insurers stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.",business

business_76,"Deutsche Boerse set to 'woo' LSE Bosses of Deutsche Boerse and LSE are to meet amid talk that a takeover bid for LSE will be raised to £1.5bn ($2.9bn). Last month, Deutsche Boerse tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for LSE, valuing LSE at £1.3bn. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in LSE, has also said Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, is interested in bidding for LSE. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, is due to hold talks with LSE this week and Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, chief Jean-Francois Theodore is scheduled to meet Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore's LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche Boerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Thursday, in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December. LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed £1.3bn offer in December, saying Deutsche Boerse's proposed £1.3bn offer in December undervalued LSE. But LSE agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a ""significantly-improved proposal"" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris-based, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: ""There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made."" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. According to the FT, in Deutsche Boerse's latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the LSE exchange. the FT said Deutsche Boerse will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of LSE and let his LSE counterpart Clara Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling Deutsche Boerse's Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. Deutsche Boerse's ownership of its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions was seen as the main stumbling block to a LSE-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force LSE shareholders to use its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions, making it difficult for LSE shareholders to negotiate for lower transaction fees.",business
business_77,"High fuel prices hit BA's's profits BA's has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. Reporting BA's's results for the three months to 31 December 2004, BA's made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's's chief executive, said its results for the three months to 31 December 2004 were ""respectable"" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA's's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and BA's expects a rise in full-year revenues. To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA's last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. In October, BA's increased a fuel surcharge for passengers from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of BA's's additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the three months to 31 December 2004 was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to BA's's full year results to March 2005, BA's warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as BA's continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, BA's said sales would be better than previously forecast. ""For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,"" BA's chairman Martin Broughton said. BA's had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. BA's also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's's latest quarterly results as ""pretty modest"". ""its results for the three months to 31 December 2004 is quite good on the revenue side and its results for the three months to 31 December 2004 shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,"" Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA's has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. ""BA's's focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in BA's's products,"" Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said. ""For example, BA's have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month BA's will start further improvements to BA's's Club World flat beds.""

In a filing to US regulators Continental Airlines warned of ""inadequate liquidity"" if Continental Airlines fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of February. Continental Airlines also said that, if Continental Airlines did not make any cuts, Continental Airlines expects to lose ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in 2005 in current market conditions. Failure to make cutbacks may also push Continental Airlines to reduce Continental Airlines's fleet, Continental Airlines said. Shares in Continental Airlines had fallen 6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 GMT. ""Without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, Continental Airlines believe that Continental Airlines's ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain,"" Continental Airlines said in Continental Airlines's filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

business_80,"Mixed Christmas for US retailers US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales. Upscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher than during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young women's clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw Wal-Mart's sales rise after Wal-Mart cut prices. Wal-Mart saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier. Customers at Wal-Mart are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to America's economic woes. Commentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a ""stand-off"" with shoppers, stepping up Wal-Mart's discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, December sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse. ""So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split,"" Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. ""Stores that have been that trend over the last couple of months appear to be continuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month."" Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier. One discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and varied. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports's same store sales sink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports battled fierce competition. Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed Leading electronics chain Best Buy's sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the December period. Accessory vendor Claire's Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving Accessory vendor Claire's Stores's same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt little December cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year. ""December was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw a dearth of exciting, new items,"" Kurt Barnard, president of industry forecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the desertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores.

According to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added December. 157,000 new jobs took last year's's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's's main concerns for US. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if The unemployment rate is to drop. ""It was a respectable report,"" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities. ""Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but Daiwa Securities had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment."" ""Manufacturing is a cyclical area of US and if Manufacturing's showing job growth, it's a good indication that US is on a solid growth track."" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue the Federal Reserve's policy of raising interest rates. the Federal Reserve lifted borrowing costs five times last year's to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust. Job creation was one of last year's's main concerns for US, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. ""Overall, compared to the previous year US looks great, US just keeps going stronger and stronger and Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York expect that to be the case"" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",business

A tie-up between Barclays and US bank Wells Fargo would create the world's fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn (£96bn). Barclays has declined to comment on a weekend press report that it had held merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo, saying Barclays does not respond to market speculation. Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo reportedly held talks in October and November 2004. Barclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in London on Monday, making Barclays the second biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index.

The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. China's tax chief said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn). According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to China's tax chief. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in the United States. The peg keeping its currency, the yuan around 8.30 to the weakening dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home.

Jubilant investors danced on the streets as The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that an economic boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the ""bubble may burst any time"".

""Whenever The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) reflects Pakistan's's true economic reality, The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) is described as a bubble."" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani feels that The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s current level rests on sound foundations. Market analysts are inclined to agree with KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s performance. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). Standard & Poor's upgraded Pakistan's a few weeks ago. There are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of February. Then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. ""Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani am least surprised at The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s performance,"" says KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani.

A lot of Arab money, One leading Karachi broker says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan's, draw some of the Arab money to The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). Locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s advantage. An anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, has fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's husband, has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition Pakistan People's Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan's on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. This, analysts say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of India and Pakistan's disagreements. The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US.

Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. Equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel. At the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying a range of manufacturers's hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their ""green"" credentials.

business_91,"US retail sales surge in December US retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales. Seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in December, compared to 0.1% a month earlier, boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after Christmas. Sales The gains 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. The gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started. The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for December to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). Sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion However, if automotives are excluded from December's data, retail sales rose just 0.3% on December. Home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well, rising 2.2%. But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for more US consumers's purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. However, analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal Reserve Bank off the Federal Reserve Bank's current policy of measured interest rate rises. ""Consumers for now that attitude willing to spend freely, sustaining the US expansion. Given that attitude, the Federal Reserve Bank remains likely to continue boosting the the Federal Reserve Bank funds rate at upcoming meetings,"" UBS economist Maury Harris told Reuters. Retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US. Consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the US battled to recover from the US's first recession of the decade and the World Trade Centre attacks. During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. Looking ahead, analysts now The belief improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the High Street with consumer spending remaining strong. The belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. The number of Americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367,000, the highest rate since September. However, long-term claims slipped to long-term claims's lowest level since 2001.",business

The US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities The latest increase 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in the previous month. Analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw production fall 0.5% - had been excluded the data would have been more impressive. The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in the past year. Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy, with The latest increase coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales. ""This is very consistent with an economy growing at 3.5 to 4.0%.

Meanwhile, the amount of factory capacity in use during November rose to 77.6% - the amount of factory capacity in use during the month's highest level since May 2001.

business_94,"'Golden economic period' to end Ten years of ""golden"" economic performance may come to an end in this year with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned. The UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. City consultancy Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's's forecast of 3% to 3.5%. City consultancy Deloitte also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of this year. In City consultancy Deloitte's quarterly economic review, City consultancy Deloitte said The UK economy had enjoyed a ""golden period"" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at inflation's lowest since the 1960s. But City consultancy Deloitte warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major ""imbalances"" in The UK economy. City consultancy Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: ""The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market. ""Whereas the main driver of The UK economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, robust household spending growth is likely to suffer as the slowdown in the housing market gathers pace."" Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, City consultancy Deloitte believes. Chancellor Gordon Brown's will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, City consultancy Deloitte claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in this year and 2006 compared to last year, when The UK economy expanded by 3.25%. However, City consultancy Deloitte stressed that the slowdown in the housing market was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while City consultancy Deloitte expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of The UK economy faltering. City consultancy Deloitte expects a series of ""aggressive"" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from the cost of borrowing's current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. ""Although this year may not be the year when things go completely wrong, this year will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for The UK economy,"" Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle.",business

Production dropped 1.6% in October, reflecting a decline in exports, while unemployment levels edged up 0.1% to 4.7%, slightly higher than forecast. Japan has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand. Japan remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand. Analysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output. According to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. Although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, inventories were 36% higher than a year ago. ""a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output's a sign that Japan's adjustment phase is stronger than expected,"" said Takashi Yamanaka, an economist with UFJ Bank. Japan downgraded Japan's overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year. Growth slowed to 0.3% in the quarter ending September 30, down from 6.3% in the first quarter of 2004. Experts believe Japan -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government officials played down figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient.

Car ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a half million cars on Beijing's roads. The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use indoor car parks. Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option.
