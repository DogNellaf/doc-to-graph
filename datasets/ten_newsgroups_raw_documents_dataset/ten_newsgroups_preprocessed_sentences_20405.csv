graphics_32,"As we mentioned in one of our previous articles about graphic design, graphic design can be described as the sphere of human activity that lies on the crossroads of several directions, first of all, visual arts, communication, and psychology.",graphics_32_1,graphics
graphics_32,"Basically, graphic designers do the job of communication to others by means of graphic (visual) elements such as images of different styles and complexity, types and fonts, pictograms, shapes and sizes, colors and shades, lines and curves, etc.",graphics_32_2,graphics
graphics_32,"Graphic designer makes all those elements of visual perception transfer the message, so Graphic designer makes all those elements of visual perception functional.",graphics_32_3,graphics
graphics_32,"Therefore, we could say that graphic designers are artists applying graphic designers's talents mostly not in pure art but communicating and purposeful art.",graphics_32_4,graphics

graphics_34,It rarely happens that the object of graphic design serves only one objective.,graphics_34_8,graphics
graphics_34,"Looking over the most essential of diverse purposes, we would mention the following.",graphics_34_9,graphics
graphics_34,"Identifying only one objective, first of all, serves for branding reasons.",graphics_34_10,graphics
graphics_34,only one objective is primarily concerned about creating logos which usually lies the foundation for the whole branding strategy.,graphics_34_11,graphics
graphics_34,"This is the task at which designers work with multiple factors combining specific features of the target audience, laws, and rules of artistic harmony, the psychology of color and shape impact on human perception and emotions, the current situation on the market, business goals of the brand or company.",graphics_34_12,graphics
graphics_34,"Numerous logos accomplished by studio designers have proved that this symbolic image plays the crucial role in all the next stages of brand strategy, including print work (like posters, business cards, corporate documentation templates, etc.), interface design (when brand or company uses digital sources and channels of reaching brand or company's clients like blogs, websites, apps, widgets, etc.), branded items (like stationery, cups, notebooks, etc.) and other directions.",graphics_34_13,graphics
graphics_34,The efficient logo is usually based on deep analysis supported by designer’s talent and skills and presents a balanced mixture of art and functionality.,graphics_34_14,graphics

graphics_51,Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?  ,graphics_51_34,graphics
graphics_51,"(Kouhia Juhana)'s solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit image Yes  (Kouhia Juhana) am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!",graphics_51_35,graphics
graphics_51,"-- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.  ",graphics_51_36,graphics
graphics_51,(Kouhia Juhana) do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.,graphics_51_37,graphics
graphics_51,About this feature individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image.,graphics_51_38,graphics
graphics_51,"What are  (Kouhia Juhana) saying XV allows this feature, but  (Kouhia Juhana) don't recommend to use this feature with the mentioned type images.",graphics_51_39,graphics
graphics_51,Ah!,graphics_51_40,graphics
graphics_51,now we see thew problem!,graphics_51_41,graphics
graphics_51,First  (Kouhia Juhana) want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images.,graphics_51_42,graphics
graphics_51,Then  (Kouhia Juhana) point out problems with this.,graphics_51_43,graphics
graphics_51,"Now  (Kouhia Juhana) are saying there is no problem because  (Kouhia Juhana), personally, happen not to use those parts of XV that cause the problem!!",graphics_51_44,graphics
graphics_51,"Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes.",graphics_51_45,graphics
graphics_51,Not sure what  (Kouhia Juhana) are saying here.,graphics_51_46,graphics
graphics_51,Certainly one can make local changes.,graphics_51_47,graphics
graphics_51,"In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job.",graphics_51_48,graphics
graphics_51,"If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified.",graphics_51_49,graphics
graphics_51,"Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized).",graphics_51_50,graphics
graphics_51,"To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area.",graphics_51_51,graphics
graphics_51,Yes that is one possible approach.  ,graphics_51_52,graphics
graphics_51,"(Kouhia Juhana) would find a program that took such an approach clumsy, however.",graphics_51_53,graphics
graphics_51,"Ok,  (Kouhia Juhana) don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such.",graphics_51_54,graphics
graphics_51,Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen,graphics_51_55,graphics
graphics_51,Well here we agree -  (Kouhia Juhana) have not thought it through very much.  ,graphics_51_56,graphics
graphics_51,(Kouhia Juhana) don't seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict  (Kouhia Juhana) from one post to the next.,graphics_51_57,graphics
graphics_51,"OK, we all have off days - perhaps  (Kouhia Juhana) should step back and think this one through.",graphics_51_58,graphics
graphics_51,Yes again.,graphics_51_59,graphics
graphics_51,What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?,graphics_51_60,graphics
graphics_51,xv saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that.,graphics_51_61,graphics
graphics_51,"As  (Kouhia Juhana) said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm.",graphics_51_62,graphics
graphics_51,JPEG is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression.  ,graphics_51_63,graphics
graphics_51,(Kouhia Juhana) fail to see what the problem is.  ,graphics_51_64,graphics
graphics_51,(Kouhia Juhana) have not proposed any workable alternatives.,graphics_51_65,graphics
graphics_51,"Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; Speak for  (Kouhia Juhana).  ",graphics_51_66,graphics
graphics_51,"(Kouhia Juhana) are the *only* person  (Kouhia Juhana) have met or spoken to who, having this process a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow reverse when a 24 bit image is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette.",graphics_51_67,graphics
graphics_51,Perhaps that is why  (Kouhia Juhana) yused the singular?,graphics_51_68,graphics
graphics_51,"say, person would like to crop part of the image and save part of the image, then it is expected that the image still is the same.",graphics_51_69,graphics
graphics_51,"Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - the main control panel tells you how many colours have been allocated to a 24 bit image.",graphics_51_70,graphics
graphics_51,XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file.,graphics_51_71,graphics
graphics_51,You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.,graphics_51_72,graphics
graphics_51,"So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.",graphics_51_73,graphics
graphics_51,Is a design error the same as a bug?,graphics_51_74,graphics
graphics_51,;-) Read  (Kouhia Juhana)'s lips.,graphics_51_75,graphics
graphics_51,XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images.,graphics_51_76,graphics
graphics_51,XV lets you import other images.,graphics_51_77,graphics
graphics_51,"XV shows,  (Kouhia Juhana) would say, a good deal of thought about the human interface.",graphics_51_78,graphics
graphics_51,And everyone else seems to use XV happily for the purpose XV was designed for.,graphics_51_79,graphics
graphics_51,XV makes no false claims.  ,graphics_51_80,graphics
graphics_51,"(Kouhia Juhana) have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.",graphics_51_81,graphics
graphics_51,"If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work.",graphics_51_82,graphics
graphics_51,"So far, you have not done so.",graphics_51_83,graphics
graphics_51,"So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.",graphics_51_84,graphics

graphics_51,`Very easily'.,graphics_51_87,graphics
graphics_51,"OK, go ahead and code it if it is so easy.",graphics_51_88,graphics
graphics_51,"Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.",graphics_51_89,graphics

graphics_53,What is image editing?,graphics_53_1,graphics
graphics_53,Why image editing is so important?,graphics_53_2,graphics
graphics_53,Well most of us may know the answer because nowadays people click pictures everywhere with not only professional cameras but also with smartphone cameras.,graphics_53_3,graphics
graphics_53,Who does not want to look beautiful?,graphics_53_4,graphics
graphics_53,Everyone wants to look gorgeous or want the images they click to look beautiful.,graphics_53_5,graphics
graphics_53,Pictures straight out of the camera may look okay or even more than okay with expensive cameras but Pictures straight out of the camera are not perfect at all.,graphics_53_6,graphics
graphics_53,To make images perfect image editing or post-processing is necessary.,graphics_53_7,graphics
graphics_53,"Graphic designers or photoshop experts have professional knowledge of image editing software like Adobe photoshop cc, lightroom, illustration, etc.",graphics_53_8,graphics
graphics_53,Most of the photographers also learn photoshop to edit Most of the photographers's image on Most of the photographers's own but this slows down the productivity of Most of the photographers.,graphics_53_9,graphics
graphics_53,"So, today’s article is not only for the editors and designers but also for the photographers who can speed up their editing process with this basic editing.",graphics_53_10,graphics
graphics_53,Image Editing Tips For Graphic Designers And Photographers,graphics_53_11,graphics
graphics_53,The 5 image editing tips I am going to talk about today is for speeding up the editing process so that you can focus on the more important and critical things.,graphics_53_12,graphics
graphics_53,"Of course, if you are a graphic designer or a photoshop expert, the most important thing for you is editing but if you are a photographer then clicking pictures is more important than editing.",graphics_53_13,graphics
graphics_53,The photo editing tips I am going to share is a combination of a few basic editing and easing the workflow for you.,graphics_53_14,graphics
graphics_53,"So, let’s get started without any delay…",graphics_53_15,graphics
graphics_54,Straighten and Crop After you insert your image into an image editing software the first thing you should do is to ensure your image is straight enough.,graphics_54_0,graphics
graphics_54,Framing is an important aspect of making images look from good to great.,graphics_54_1,graphics
graphics_54,To hit the right spot with image framing you should have to have the knowledge about photography and framing.,graphics_54_2,graphics
graphics_54,I can give you what I know but let’s keep that for another day.,graphics_54_3,graphics
graphics_54,So the first thing is to straighten your image and this can be done by cropping your image.,graphics_54_4,graphics
graphics_54,Use the cropping tool of your image editing software and use a grid view while you crop.,graphics_54_5,graphics
graphics_54,Why a grid view is important?,graphics_54_6,graphics
graphics_54,"Well, the whole photography or cinematography is standing upon one rule.",graphics_54_7,graphics
graphics_54,one rule is the “Rule of Thirds”.,graphics_54_8,graphics
graphics_54,To be able to put your image one one rule you have to use a grid view.,graphics_54_9,graphics
graphics_54,"So, use a grid view and crop tool, then crop your image, straighten your image, put your image in one rule.",graphics_54_10,graphics
graphics_54,Remove Dust Particles,graphics_54_11,graphics
graphics_54,The next must-do thing in your image editing is fixing the image.,graphics_54_12,graphics
graphics_54,"The process that we use to remove dust, spots, blemishes, and wrinkles from a photo is the photo retouching service.",graphics_54_13,graphics
graphics_54,"In the photo retouching service, we use the Healing Brush Tool, Patch Tool, Red Eye, Clone Tool, Eraser Tool, Blur Tool, Dodge, and Burn Tools to fix the imperfection of the image.",graphics_54_14,graphics
graphics_54,"During the photoshoot, a photographer tries as hard as possible to get the perfect click but the raw image from the camera may contain dust particles, or maybe something came into the background.",graphics_54_15,graphics
graphics_54,These are unavoidable and uncontrollable circumstances.,graphics_54_16,graphics
graphics_54,So what should we do if we face something like this?,graphics_54_17,graphics
graphics_54,The answer is image post-processing in photoshop.,graphics_54_18,graphics
graphics_54,"If you get minor spots, scratches, or blemishes image retouching technique can save you.",graphics_54_19,graphics
graphics_54,"On the other hand, if you unwanted subject appearing in your frame then the background removal process will help you.",graphics_54_20,graphics
graphics_54,In background removal service all you need to do is use the clipping path technique to select the object you want to remove and then hit the delete button.,graphics_54_21,graphics
graphics_54,"Adjust the Highlights and Shadows Highlights and shadows are an important aspect of an image and if you messed up here, your image will look awful.",graphics_54_22,graphics
graphics_54,"Generally, the photographer tries hard to keep Highlights and shadows close to perfect during the shoot.",graphics_54_23,graphics
graphics_54,"So, try to achieve the maximum balance of highlights and shadow in the raw image and then make the raw image perfect in post-processing.",graphics_54_24,graphics

graphics_61,Because in the image manipulation technique you can manipulate almost everything around the subject without the lighting and shadow.,graphics_61_1,graphics

graphics_61,"Well, presets or actions are a combination of image editing that is saved and you can use presets or actions on a similar kind of image to get similar output but faster than before.",graphics_61_9,graphics
graphics_61,How to use presets?,graphics_61_10,graphics
graphics_61,It’s easy to just insert your image and do some basic touch up and then got to the preset menu and selects the saved preset in your computer and hit apply.,graphics_61_11,graphics
graphics_61,Your image will get a similar filter that the preset holds.,graphics_61_12,graphics
graphics_61,By using presets and actions you can achieve faster workflow like never before.,graphics_61_13,graphics

graphics_61,"In Lightroom, you can do batch editing.",graphics_61_17,graphics
graphics_61,"Basically, batch editing is a process by which editors use a preset and select all the images and make a batch of all the images that editors want to edit.",graphics_61_18,graphics
graphics_61,Then editors apply a preset to a batch of them that they want to edit and all of the images in a batch of them that they want to edit get the same editing in a matter of time.,graphics_61_19,graphics

graphics_84,Graphic design is the craft of creating visual content to communicate messages.,graphics_84_1,graphics

graphics_84,"As a term originating in the 1920s’ print industry and covering a range of activities including logo creation, Graphic design concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing – attracting viewers using images, color and typography.",graphics_84_5,graphics
graphics_84,"However, graphic designers working in user experience (UX) design must justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach, focusing on—and seeking maximum empathy with—users while creating good-looking designs that maximize usability.",graphics_84_6,graphics
graphics_84,Aesthetics must serve a purpose – in UX design we don’t create art for art’s sake.,graphics_84_7,graphics
graphics_84,"So, when doing graphic design for UX, you should consider the information architecture of your interactive designs, to ensure accessibility for users, and leverage graphic design skills in creating output that considers the entire user experience, including users’ visual processing abilities.",graphics_84_8,graphics
graphics_84,"For instance, if an otherwise pleasing mobile app can’t offer users what users need in several thumb-clicks, an otherwise pleasing mobile app's designers will have failed to marry graphic design to user experience.",graphics_84_9,graphics

graphics_87,UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) need a method that would do this in as little time as possible for use in a forward raytracing program.,graphics_87_12,graphics
graphics_87,UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) think that this topic is a very difficult problem.,graphics_87_13,graphics
graphics_87,"To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.",graphics_87_14,graphics
graphics_87,Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.,graphics_87_15,graphics
graphics_87,"First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.",graphics_87_16,graphics
graphics_87,"Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.",graphics_87_17,graphics
graphics_87,"Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polygon.",graphics_87_18,graphics
graphics_87,"Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so this question is a decision problem.",graphics_87_19,graphics
graphics_87,"One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce this question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q. An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.",graphics_87_20,graphics
graphics_87,"In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.",graphics_87_21,graphics
graphics_87,"(See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).",graphics_87_22,graphics
graphics_87,"So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a a new language called PostScript program that draws a line L and a polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer.",graphics_87_23,graphics
graphics_87,"By ""output"", we mean a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P executes a command called ""showpage"", which actually prints a page of paper containing a line L and a polygon P. A quick examination of a page of paper containing the line and the polygon provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original decision problem.",graphics_87_24,graphics
graphics_87,There are two small problems with this approach.,graphics_87_25,graphics
graphics_87,(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode a line L and P into the reduced problem Q,graphics_87_26,graphics
graphics_87,"So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).",graphics_87_27,graphics
graphics_87,"But the use of the Axiom of Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma) is not regarded in a very serious light these days.",graphics_87_28,graphics
graphics_87,"(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the a new language called PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in other words, will the PostScript program Q halt?",graphics_87_29,graphics
graphics_87,"Now, a new language called PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for a new language called PostScript) is undecidable.",graphics_87_30,graphics
graphics_87,It is quite possible that the original decision problem will turn out to be undecidable.,graphics_87_31,graphics

graphics_90,Procreate makes designing on an iPad easier and more efficient in a completely new way.,graphics_90_2,graphics
graphics_90,But can a $9.99 app be a realistic Photoshop competitor?,graphics_90_3,graphics
graphics_90,"For some, the answer is a definite yes.",graphics_90_4,graphics
graphics_90,Here are five reasons Procreate could become your go-to design app (and five reasons why Procreate might not).,graphics_90_5,graphics
graphics_90,"Plus, an introduction to what Procreate is, and why Procreate might be the perfect app for you.",graphics_90_6,graphics
graphics_90,What is Procreate?,graphics_90_7,graphics
graphics_90,"If you aren’t familiar with Procreate, Procreate’s an iPad app that’s made for professional creatives.",graphics_90_8,graphics
graphics_90,"You can sketch, paint and edit with a robust collection of tools.",graphics_90_9,graphics
graphics_90,Procreate responds to touch and pressure with the Apple Pencil for detailed work.,graphics_90_10,graphics
graphics_90,Procreate includes a sleek interface and is a game changer when it comes to online drawing apps.,graphics_90_11,graphics
graphics_90,"Procreate includes 64-bit color, customizable brushes, incredible canvas resolutions, a nice layer system, and cinema-style effects.",graphics_90_12,graphics
graphics_90,"Plus, everything includes the ease of use you’d expect from an Apple product (and you can save images from device to device).",graphics_90_13,graphics
graphics_90,"While Procreate is fun for a lot of creatives, Procreate most practical applications are for sketching, illustrations, some light editing and for drawing typography.",graphics_90_14,graphics

graphics_90,"The image tweaking – we won’t call this an editing suite – includes blurs, sharpening, curve manipulation, color balance and more.",graphics_90_20,graphics
graphics_90,"Think of blurs, sharpening, curve manipulation, color balance and more as giving you the ability to design a cool filter of your own (Instagram style) and apply a cool filter of your own to images.",graphics_90_21,graphics
graphics_90,Then you can make it super fun with a time-lapse view of the changes that you can share.,graphics_90_22,graphics
graphics_90,a time-lapse view of the changes that you can share is great for designers that are experimenting with new techniques and want to get or give feedback.,graphics_90_23,graphics
graphics_90,"For editing on a tablet, a time-lapse view of the changes that you can share is probably one of the best, and most professional options available.",graphics_90_24,graphics
graphics_90,"While tweaking images is fun, Procreate is really designed for illustrators.",graphics_90_25,graphics
graphics_90,The brush library has more than 130 brushes that create almost any art technique you can images.,graphics_90_26,graphics
graphics_90,There’s also a dual-texture system so you can mix and match brush types.,graphics_90_27,graphics
graphics_90,Every brush is customizable as well.,graphics_90_28,graphics
graphics_90,(You’d be hard-pressed to have this many tools in an actual studio.),graphics_90_29,graphics
graphics_90,And we have a collection of 30+ of the best Procreate brushes to get you started!,graphics_90_30,graphics
graphics_90,What sets Procreate apart in terms of illustration is that Procreate is a professional set of tools.,graphics_90_31,graphics
graphics_90,You can create a huge canvas to work on and export the drawings in high resolution still or video frames.,graphics_90_32,graphics
graphics_90,It’s hard to imagine how cool Procreate are until you start playing with Procreate.,graphics_90_33,graphics

medical_38,I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and the pediatrician *I* went to for many years didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years.,medical_38_4,medical

medical_79,Steve don't think that using anti-fungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of commission or omission.,medical_79_18,medical

medical_89,"Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8).",medical_89_45,medical
medical_89,Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births (5).,medical_89_46,medical
medical_89,"Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs.",medical_89_47,medical
medical_89,"For example, in 1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and $4720, respectively.",medical_89_48,medical
medical_89,The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6).,medical_89_49,medical
medical_89,"If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges.",medical_89_50,medical
medical_89,"Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery.",medical_89_51,medical
medical_89,"For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7).",medical_89_52,medical
medical_89,"Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8).",medical_89_53,medical
medical_89,"Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) was 5.7%.",medical_89_54,medical
medical_89,"The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted.",medical_89_55,medical
medical_89,"To reach the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery, however, increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate.",medical_89_56,medical
medical_89,"One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review process (10).",medical_89_57,medical
medical_89,"Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery (4).",medical_89_58,medical

space_76,Anyone out there know?,space_76_3,space
space_76,Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.,space_76_4,space
space_76,"When graphed, flight constraints for speed/AOA/power define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where that aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.",space_76_5,space
space_76,"Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.",space_76_6,space
space_76,"Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.",space_76_7,space
space_76,"Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.",space_76_8,space
space_76,"Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during the F-16's high-speed taxi tests).",space_76_9,space

space_92,"But alas, 'twere not so.",space_92_9,space
space_92,Mercury's's perihelion precesses at the rate Mercury's perihelion does because the space where Mercury's perihelion resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.,space_92_10,space
space_92,This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's's synthesis of Albert Einstein's's earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry.,space_92_11,space
space_92,"The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of the General Theory of Relativity most noteworthy strengths is that the General Theory of Relativity accounts for the precession of Mercury's's perihelion almost exactly.",space_92_12,space

technologie_99,There are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as multimedia messages might.,technologie_99_15,technologie
technologie_99,"Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.",technologie_99_16,technologie
technologie_99,"""The rate messaging firm Mblox can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant,"" Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said.",technologie_99_17,technologie
technologie_99,The reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users.,technologie_99_18,technologie
technologie_99,"No-one wants to take the risk of swamping the second generation networks that currently have the most users so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox,.",technologie_99_19,technologie
technologie_99,"This has led to operators finding other technologies, particularly one known as Wap-push, to get multimedia to operators's customers.",technologie_99_20,technologie
technologie_99,"But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to networks's customers, the results can be dramatic.",technologie_99_21,technologie
technologie_99,Israeli technology firm Celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth.,technologie_99_22,technologie
technologie_99,"One of the first firms to use the Israeli technology firm Celltick service is Hutch India, the largest mobile firm in the country.",technologie_99_23,technologie
technologie_99,the Celltick service gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems.,technologie_99_24,technologie
technologie_99,"While not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing people's phones as a device that can handle all different types of content.",technologie_99_25,technologie
technologie_99,"As a result 40% of the subscribers to the Hutch Alive, which uses Israeli technology firm Celltick's broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator.",technologie_99_26,technologie
technologie_99,"""Operators really need to start utilising the Celltick service to reach Operators's customers,"" said Yaron Toren, spokesman for Israeli technology firm Celltick.",technologie_99_27,technologie
technologie_99,"Until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.",technologie_99_28,technologie
