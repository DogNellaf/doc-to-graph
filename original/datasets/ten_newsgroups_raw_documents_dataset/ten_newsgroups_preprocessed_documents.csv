business_0,"Lufthansa flies back to profit Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003. In a preliminary report, Lufthansa announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; £274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. Lufthansa was also hit by troubles at Lufthansa's US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. Lufthansa said that Lufthansa will give all the details of Lufthansa's 2004 results on 23 March.",business
business_1,"Japanese growth grinds to a halt Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough. Output in the three months to September grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion. an economy not long out of a decade-long trough had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept Japanese shoppers from spending. The effect was to leave an economy not long out of a decade-long trough more dependent than ever on exports for an economy not long out of a decade-long trough's recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive. The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. ""Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,"" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. ""Personal consumption looks good, but Personal consumption was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. ""The amber light is flashing."" The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy The government will have to implement when an economy not long out of a decade-long trough picks up to help deal with Japan's massive public debt.",business

WorldCom had been overstating WorldCom's accounts by $11bn (£8.5bn). The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following his former boss Bernard Ebbers's trial, where The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom is appearing as a prosecution witness. his former boss Bernard Ebbers has always insisted that his former boss Bernard Ebbers was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances.

business_4,"Peugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi Mitsubishi has struck a deal to supply Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV). The two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say The two firms expect to seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. a Memorandum of Understanding comes as a badly-needed boost for Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV) will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives Mitsubishi a chance to utilise some of underused capacity. In January, Mitsubishi issued Mitsubishi's third profits warning in nine months, and cut Mitsubishi's sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that Mitsubishi had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, Mitsubishi has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month Mitsubishi said Mitsubishi was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down Last month to shoulder responsibility for Mitsubishi's troubles. Mitsubishi has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in Mitsubishi's current financial year to March 2005.

business_5,"US adds more jobs than expected The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations. In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of The US economy except manufacturing. While the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, this was because more people were now actively seeking work. The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. In addition, Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. the Labor Department figures had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. ""It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,"" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons. Other analysts said the Labor Department figures made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when the US Federal Reserve meets next week. ""the Labor Department figures should empower the US Federal Reserve to clearly do something,"" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of Labor Department, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned investors's attention to other economic factors, such as the US's record trade deficit. There is also speculation that newly re-elected President George W Bush will deliberately try to keep The dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.",business

Winn-Dixie said bankruptcy protection would enable Winn-Dixie to successfully restructure. Winn-Dixie said Winn-Dixie's 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said Winn-Dixie would most likely off-load a number of sites. Winn-Dixie has total debts of $1.87bn (£980m). In Winn-Dixie's bankruptcy petition Winn-Dixie listed Winn-Dixie's biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which Winn-Dixie owes $15.1m. Analysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie's slide into bankruptcy was widely expected.

business_10,"Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has GM's announcement that General Motors, the world's largest car maker, will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s loss-making Saab factory in Sweden. The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s efforts to make a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS appeal to European drivers, a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine. General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden has been at the centre of rumours about General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s planned severe cutbacks in General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s troubled European operations. But General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s new commitment to its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden may not be welcomed by General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany may now have to face a larger proportion of General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s cuts. Neither will GM's announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since GM's announcement reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said Saab is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. the lucrative European luxury car market's leaders do not agree. General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s plans to build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS in Sweden is part of General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s efforts to push a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes and BMW have retained German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW's stranglehold on the lucrative European luxury car market. Bringing a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. fewer than 130,000 cars per year is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s European operations, General Motors, the world's largest car maker, is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saab to the US, a market where drivers have adopted Saab as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saab more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. ""a leading European car maker know that in five years the weak US dollar will be stronger than the weak US dollar is today,"" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was ""stupid"", the chief executive of a leading European car maker said. In a separate announcement, General Motors, the world's largest car maker, unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive General Motors, the world's largest car maker,'s Opel and Vauxhall models. a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models follows a similar initiative by General Motors, the world's largest car maker, in the US. General Motors, the world's largest car maker, said General Motors, the world's largest car maker, wanted to change ""customers''s perceptions"" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing customers' that the quality had improved in recent years.",business

business_14,"China keeps tight rein on credit China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by The curbs down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report. The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, China has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a ""hard landing"" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of China's peg. To some extent, The curbs do seem to be taking effect.

The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. bankruptcy followed MCI's admission in 2002 that MCI illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Shareholders lost about $180bn when MCI collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost 20,000 workers's jobs. Former previous name WorldCom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has Qwest come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that Qwest manipulated Qwest's results to keep Wall Street happy. MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after former long-distance giant AT&T Consolidation in The US telecoms market has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.

business_19,"Brewers' profits lose Brewers' profits's fizz Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the world's's largest brewers, have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat. Heineken saw Heineken's annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in the year may also slide. Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the world's largest brewers, are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature. Heineken's net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; £371m) during the year, from 798m euro a year ago. Heineken blamed weak demand in western Europe and currency losses. Heineken had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off Heineken's operating profits. Despite the dip in profits, Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said Heineken now plans to invest 100m euros in ""aggressive"" and ""high-impact"" marketing in Europe and the US in the year. Heineken said Heineken would also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries. Heineken increased Heineken's dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in the year net profit. Carlsberg, the world's's fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Carlsberg's beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries. Nevertheless, total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about the year, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. However, Carlsberg also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, imported brands. ""investment bank Merrill Lynch remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, social and structural reasons,"" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg.",business

At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery. Analysts, however, pointed to Dollar's inability recently to extend something of a recovery despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the US's's economic problems had not disappeared.

business_23,"India and Russia in energy talks India and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part of a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects. On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India's ONGC. India's ONGC is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos. India's ONGC is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft. Russian media reported that India and Russia signed a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Russian energy giant Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India's petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar. a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects is likely to see India and Russia develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia. India's ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea. India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year. India's ONGC's Mr Raha said India and Russia could work together on joint bids from next year. ""At current oil and gas prices, India's ONGC's cash flow situation is good,"" Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha told Reuters. ""What India's ONGC are saying is - Russian energy giant Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and India's ONGC have the money. ""The investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so."" Russian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of oil unit Yuganskneftegas at a meeting on Tuesday. India's ONGC's Mr Raha declined to be drawn on Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha's firm's reported interest in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. However, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha stressed that India's ONGC was not interested in a 'loan-for-oil deal' in connection to oil unit Yuganskneftegas, similar to that concluded recently between state-owned energy giant Rosneft and China's's National Petroleum Corporation.

business_24,"Weak data buffets French economy A batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over French economy's future prospects. Official figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in last month. At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth. ""[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,"" finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy said. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand. Analysts said French companies, keen to protect French companies's profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. ""[Official figures] show the main problem of French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,"" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. ""Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late."" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects French economy to grow by about 2.4% the year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. about 2.4% is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.",business
business_25,"Business fears over sluggish EU economy As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business. Lille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of France at the weekend. But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, and consider that the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like northern England and industrial Scotland, coal, steel and textiles have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille. Beck-Crespel has not laid off a worker since 1945. Beck-Crespel specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry are being built in Europe these days. Director Hugues Charbonnier says Director Hugues Charbonnier is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of Director Hugues Charbonnier's output more cheaply, while Director Hugues Charbonnier's key markets are now in China and India. ""In Beck-Crespel's business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with Beck-Crespel's size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union, (if Beck-Crespel did that) Beck-Crespel would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,"" Director Hugues Charbonnier says. It isn't just globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though workers work just 35 hours. But at least there is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference. That is one reason why people here are not great fans of EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille. ""In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas the unemployment rate is 15%. people here don't see what Europe is doing for people here, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,"" Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille says. Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from euro it is here. euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. Much of trade passes through the world's largest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec. specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec's cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec's main customers are closer. Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. ""In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in EU it is more or less 1%,"" Boss Henk Addink says. Boss Henk Addink blames euro for stifling demand. Boss Henk Addink much preferred the old currencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country's economic performance. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In Britain this year would be a bad year; in Germany this year is one of the best in recent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem. If Germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across Europe is never going to be as strong as growth across the bloc could be. However, at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing. The Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after Siemens threatened to take one factory near the Dutch border and Staff's jobs to Hungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that Factory manager Herbert Stueker now hopes to increase productivity ""by nearly 30%"". But Germany needs much more reform if all Germany's industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. ""Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we could solve the main problem we could cut unemployment by half,"" Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University says. EU set EU the target of that process the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. Four years into that process, and the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010 seems further away than ever.",business

The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of its struggling car business, with Herbert Demel leaving its struggling car business. The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years. Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales. its struggling car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its struggling car business's break-even target from 2005 to 2006. The management changes are part of a wider shake-up of its struggling car business following Fiat's resolution of Fiat's dispute with General Motors. As part of a major restructuring, Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently owned by Ferrari - within Fiat's own operations. Ferrari, in which Fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about £10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said The Treasury's plans were on track and funded until 2008. According to The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), if UK's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is ""unlikely"" golden rule will be met. Should the government's current economic cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to ""50/50"". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said. a report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. accountancy firm Ernst & Young the latest claims revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A The Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying The Treasury was ""on track to meeting spending rules and golden rule in the government's current economic cycle and beyond"". ""Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and Spending plans are fully affordable."" Other than a report's warning on possible tax hikes, the The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy. a report said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the ""world economy will continue to grow strongly"". Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan.

business_29,"Call centre users 'lose patience' Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests. Once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. ""Customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society,"" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned a survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick customers's way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using more customers's mobile phones. The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks. ""Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now a call centre's agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,"" Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, a survey found. In what IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey calls an ""alarming development"", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving ""agents not equipped to deal with customers"". This, Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey warns, is ""scary"" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high ""churn rate"", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but about 70% is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate. Suggestions that ""outsourcing"" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says. There are ""no big differences in wait time and call resolution"" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. ""You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,"" Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey says. However, companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for a survey have no plans to the move Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey's call centres. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey give three key reasons for not making the move: - call centre operations are part of Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey's business ""core function"", - Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey are worried about the risk of going abroad, - Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey fear that Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey will damage Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey's brand if Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey join the offshoring drive. a survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents.

""The strong growth outlook for its Sandoz unit, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,"" Novartis said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to Generic drugs's more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as its Sandoz unit can copy their more expensive branded rivals usually after Producers such as Sandoz's patent protection expires and can sell their more expensive branded rivals more cheaply as Producers such as Sandoz do not have to pay research and development cost. There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that analysts call fragmented. However, not all analysts were initially convinced about The deal. ""The deal is a very expensive acquisition,"" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters. ""Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, find it strange that Novartis are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where Novartis suffered price pressure.""",business
business_31,"Economy 'strong' in election year UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. Optimism is at Optimism's highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but rates could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO Stoy Hayward optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead The rise up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. The only thing blighting business optimism the year will be uncertainties associated with the anticipated general election in May, BDO Stoy Hayward said. BDO Stoy Hayward's BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, BDO Stoy Hayward noted. BDO Stoy Hayward's inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October. ""The UK is looking strong going into the anticipated general election in May, but businesses need to prepare businesses for a jolt ahead as The Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. ""Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.""",business

The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. ""There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand,"" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in a statement. ""But growth of 0.1% in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the job market."" High oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect, Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency said. The brunt of German unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where the rate is 18.8%. With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked anger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, notably among Germany's iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called ""one-euro jobs"" which top up unemployment benefit.

A survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said employer contributions had a rise of 49.7% from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%. Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised Companies facing the biggest deficits's pension contributions by 100% or more, Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said. Many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased liabilities. A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when the scheme member retire. The rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes. money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes are less risky for employers. Under money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes, employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement. Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said there were some schemes in good health. But, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle ""yawning deficits"". The level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. In 1998/99, for example, contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. In contrast, between 1996 and 1998, some employers cut some employers's contribution levels. Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in contributions was ""staggering"" and the highest ever recorded by Incomes Data Services' (IDS). ""the IDS Pensions Service have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision,"" said Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service,. ""With figures like the rise in contributions there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in final salary schemes.""",business

business_38,"Market unfazed by Aurora setback As Aurora limped back to Aurora's dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. Aurora had another slice of bad luck to add to Aurora's history of health scares and technical trouble. And Aurora's owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped one of the world's biggest investment banks's target for the huge US Carnival Corporation's share price, from £35 to £36.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT the huge US Carnival Corporation's shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at £32.26. Why the mismatch between the public perception and Market's response? ""The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion. ""The Aurora issue was clearly a source of uncertainty for the huge US Carnival Corporation - The Aurora issue was a long cruise, after all. But Market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events."" Despite Aurora's string of bad luck, Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large the huge US Carnival Corporation fleet, the UK's's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, the huge US Carnival Corporation has a reputation for keeping the huge US Carnival Corporation's ships pretty much on schedule. ""the huge US Carnival Corporation has an incredibly strong track record,"" Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion. Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for the huge US Carnival Corporation and the huge US Carnival Corporation's main competitor, Royal Caribbean. ""While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,"" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. ""Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises."" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK's - but for the huge US Carnival Corporation customers elsewhere The Aurora issue's unlikely to make too much of a splash. Assuming that Citigroup Smith Barney is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in the huge US Carnival Corporation's favour. In the wake of the UK's P&O Princess group's takeover by the huge US Carnival Corporation, the huge US Carnival Corporation is now to a great extent a duopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, ""slowing supply growth"" is a certainty, said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. And with the huge US Carnival Corporation remaining the market leader, the huge US Carnival Corporation looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to Aurora in the future.",business

The affected vehicles in the largest recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. The affected vehicles in the product recall are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, GM is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that GM did not know of any injuries related to the problems.

Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value. However, Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa's losses were much smaller, reflecting the market's view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs.

London Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, US light crude traded in New York's lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has The falls 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) The news on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. ""It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,"" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed The falls to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil. The stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto nine-month highs by the end of Thursday. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The falls helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that The falls could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world. The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. the energy minister of Opec member Algeria said Opec member Algeria was likely to keep output unchanged when Opec member Algeria meets next week. However, some analysts believe The falls may harden Opec member Algeria's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output. Fears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in North America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.

business_43,"Markets fall on weak dollar fears Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan. The London FTSE fell 0.8% while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, Tokyo's Nikkei 225's steepest fall in three months. G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And Fed chief Alan Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit. On Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the sinking dollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of Monday. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional ""strong dollar"" policy. The latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across the US's public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the sinking dollar lower. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the traditional ""strong dollar"" policy remained unaltered. But US Treasury Secretary John Snow also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the sinking dollar. Some had looked to a finance ministers' meeting for direction. But US Treasury Secretary John Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda. For the US, letting the sinking dollar drift is a useful short-term fix. US exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close a $500bn trade gap. In the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the debt to $8.2 trillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the sinking dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US spends and what the US earns. But already the US are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. And Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the sinking dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. ""It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,"" Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said.",business

The optimism in the financial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the Japanese business community. Earlier this month, the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese manufacturers found that business confidence had the fall in confidence for the first time since March 2003. Slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall in confidence. Despite this, traders expect strength in the global economy to benefit Japan. Structural reform within Japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector's bad debt problems should also help, traders say.",business
business_48,"Iraqi voters turn to economic issues Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters. A vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. So there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. ""First rule of law, then an economy in tatters,"" says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003. Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's view about what an elected government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis. an economy in tatters has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in Iraq. Job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi people's wish list. Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. ""Estimates of Iraq's unemployment rate vary, but the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution estimate Iraq's unemployment rate to be between 30-40%,"" the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution's Iraq Index. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to Iraq's oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003. Iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. But serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. One Iraqi woman told Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq about One Iraqi woman's frustration as One Iraqi woman watched TV adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from Baghdad's's pharmacies. Observes Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003: ""an economy in tatters at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."" An indication of marks can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking principles. Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into finance. National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq. Foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. Bechtel's's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting Bechtel's's bottom line while Halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to Iraq taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq. ""the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond is seen as a selling off of Iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,"" Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq says. Consequently, an elected government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over an elected government's proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq explains. In the West, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the majority of Iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. Opinion polls suggest that ""people still want Iraq to take a leading role in providing job creation, social security and healthcare"", Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq says. Yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left Iraq three decades ago. ""Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 says. ""Iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth."" Many foreign companies say Many foreign companies are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering Iraq in any meaningful way. But there are exceptions. Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 across Iraq in Kirkuk and Baghdad's, and Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003's engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 points out.

business_49,"China continues breakneck growth China's economy has The news by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%. The news may mean more limits on investment and lending as China tries to take China's economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed China's expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if China overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year. Still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - China's first hike in nine years - in October 2004. Despite the apparent rebalancing of China's economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. ""There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,"" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings. China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China's currency. China keeps the yuan, China's currency pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist officials are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. ""We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,"" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. ""Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.""",business
business_50,"Japan's's ageing workforce: built to last In his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. And the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's life. the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune is one of Japan's's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. At the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's neat Osaka detached house, where the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune lives with one of the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's sexagenarian daughters, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Between tasks, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune reveals what the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's next goal is: ""Well, what's most important for the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune is to be Japan's's number one."" the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, Japan's, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to this phenomenon until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and Europeans. On the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu's younger friends, who are in his younger friends, who are in their seventies's seventies. ""83-year-old Yuji Shimizu think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,"" 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu remarks. ""On average, we can live longer."" Whether it's the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, Japan's's elderly are remarkable. But while life may be a game of golf for 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu's grandchildren have huge problems ahead. Japan's is the world's's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US. By 2007, Japan's's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. This means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled. ""In the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,"" explains Shigeo Morioka of the International Longevity Centre in Tokyo. So how will Japan's's finances stay on track? After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of Japan's's gross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised countries. The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan's's welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. But unfortunately, Japan's appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan, asks; ""Who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker? ""Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?"" One option is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from the Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff. Standing next to Tokyo harbour is a version of New York's Statue of Liberty. But, as yet, Japan's is not ready for an Ellis Island. ""Japan's has never really liked that option in Japan's's history and Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan think that option's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,"" insists Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan. In Japan's, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. But for the economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash. Of course the Japanese could always have more children. The government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until 2030, when today's babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, starts to unfold in 2010. In contrast to Japan's - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. Although President Bush must re-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in the US's over 65s, The International Monetary Fund foresees a positive contribution to the US current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration. Some voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the Japanese labour market. Some voices in Japanese industry want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over Japan's's ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. ""Japan's still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting Japan's's auto business or Japan's's semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,"" says Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan. Japan's can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. Falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. Come 2020, Japan's could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. There are fears that the world's's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. But none of fears that the world's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession is the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune's concern anymore. At 101, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune chuckles that, the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune feels fine.",business

Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",business

A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years. Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. ""The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,"" the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors housing spokesman Ian Perry said. ""The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate."" The figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the market. On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December.

business_64,"Battered dollar hits Thursday's new low for the dollar Battered dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy. Battered dollar hit $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to $1.3509. Battered dollar has weakened sharply since September when Battered dollar traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits. Meanwhile, France's finance minister has said the world faced ""economic catastrophe"" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls. France's finance minister said France's finance minister would seek action on currency controls at the next meeting of G7 countries in February. Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen Battered dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt Ministers from European and Asian governments's export-driven economies. ""It's absolutely essential that at the meeting of G7 countries our American friends understand that our American friends need coordinated management at the world level,"" said France's finance minister. Thursday's's new low for Battered dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity. Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% November. just 0.2% was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The official US policy is that the US supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe the US is happy to let Battered dollar fall because of the boost to the US's exporters. the US has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated Battered dollar still has further to fall from ""abnormal and dangerous heights"" set in 2002. the US says the US will let market forces determine Battered dollar's strength rather than intervene directly. Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting President Bush's aim to cut the US trade and budget deficits have prompted slight upturns in Battered dollar. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday's had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. Battered dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. ""Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London can see Battered dollar finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it's going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, finishing the year around $1.40,"" said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London.",business
business_65,"Disaster claims 'less than $10bn' Insurers have sought to calm fears that Insurers face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern Asia. Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said. Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (£5.17bn). Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, believes that the cost would be substantial but that the cost is unlikely to be in double-digit billions, the Financial Times reported. Munich Re, the world's's largest reinsurance company, said that Munich Re's exposure is less than 100m euros (£70m; $136m). At least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand among the worst hit. southern Asia's resorts and Western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants. Lloyds of London told the Financial Times Lloyds of London expected Lloyds of London's exposure to be limited to ""holiday resorts, personal accident, travel insurance and marine risks"". A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, has paid out about 300 million euros (£281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the US. But insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through. ""So many things are unclear, it is just too early to tell,"" said Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers,'s natural disasters department. ""You need very complicated processes to estimate damages. Unlike four major hurricanes in the US, you can't just run a model."" Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re's natural disasters department anticipated that Serge Troeber, deputy head of Swiss Re's natural disasters department's own company's total claims would be less then those from four major hurricanes in the US, which Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, put at $640m. Allianz, a leading German insurer, said Allianz, a leading German insurer, did not know yet what Allianz, a leading German insurer,'s exposure would be. However, Allianz, a leading German insurer, said giant waves were unlikely to have a ""significant"" impact on Allianz, a leading German insurer,'s business. Zurich Financial said Zurich Financial could not yet assess the cost of an earthquake. The impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said. Most US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. Insured damage could be a fraction of the ""billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands and Malaysia,"" said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb. ""US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. It's more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure,"" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co. Many of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldive Islands, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch. Hurricane Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. But the cost of an earthquake and giant waves on the individuals involved is incalculable. ""We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages  that have just been wiped out. Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,"" said Jan Egeland, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Tourists cutting short Tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas's holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too. The Association of British insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. The Association of British insurers said loss of possessions will usually be covered, but The Association of British insurers stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.",business

business_76,"Deutsche Boerse set to 'woo' LSE Bosses of Deutsche Boerse and LSE are to meet amid talk that a takeover bid for LSE will be raised to £1.5bn ($2.9bn). Last month, Deutsche Boerse tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for LSE, valuing LSE at £1.3bn. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in LSE, has also said Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, is interested in bidding for LSE. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, is due to hold talks with LSE this week and Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, chief Jean-Francois Theodore is scheduled to meet Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore's LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche Boerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Thursday, in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December. LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed £1.3bn offer in December, saying Deutsche Boerse's proposed £1.3bn offer in December undervalued LSE. But LSE agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a ""significantly-improved proposal"" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris-based, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: ""There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made."" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. According to the FT, in Deutsche Boerse's latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the LSE exchange. the FT said Deutsche Boerse will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of LSE and let his LSE counterpart Clara Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling Deutsche Boerse's Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. Deutsche Boerse's ownership of its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions was seen as the main stumbling block to a LSE-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force LSE shareholders to use its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions, making it difficult for LSE shareholders to negotiate for lower transaction fees.",business
business_77,"High fuel prices hit BA's's profits BA's has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. Reporting BA's's results for the three months to 31 December 2004, BA's made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's's chief executive, said its results for the three months to 31 December 2004 were ""respectable"" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA's's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and BA's expects a rise in full-year revenues. To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA's last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. In October, BA's increased a fuel surcharge for passengers from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of BA's's additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the three months to 31 December 2004 was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to BA's's full year results to March 2005, BA's warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as BA's continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, BA's said sales would be better than previously forecast. ""For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,"" BA's chairman Martin Broughton said. BA's had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. BA's also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's's latest quarterly results as ""pretty modest"". ""its results for the three months to 31 December 2004 is quite good on the revenue side and its results for the three months to 31 December 2004 shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,"" Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA's has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. ""BA's's focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in BA's's products,"" Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said. ""For example, BA's have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month BA's will start further improvements to BA's's Club World flat beds.""

In a filing to US regulators Continental Airlines warned of ""inadequate liquidity"" if Continental Airlines fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of February. Continental Airlines also said that, if Continental Airlines did not make any cuts, Continental Airlines expects to lose ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in 2005 in current market conditions. Failure to make cutbacks may also push Continental Airlines to reduce Continental Airlines's fleet, Continental Airlines said. Shares in Continental Airlines had fallen 6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 GMT. ""Without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, Continental Airlines believe that Continental Airlines's ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain,"" Continental Airlines said in Continental Airlines's filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

business_80,"Mixed Christmas for US retailers US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales. Upscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher than during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young women's clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw Wal-Mart's sales rise after Wal-Mart cut prices. Wal-Mart saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier. Customers at Wal-Mart are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to America's economic woes. Commentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a ""stand-off"" with shoppers, stepping up Wal-Mart's discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, December sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse. ""So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split,"" Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. ""Stores that have been that trend over the last couple of months appear to be continuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month."" Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier. One discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and varied. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports's same store sales sink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports battled fierce competition. Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed Leading electronics chain Best Buy's sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the December period. Accessory vendor Claire's Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving Accessory vendor Claire's Stores's same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt little December cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year. ""December was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw a dearth of exciting, new items,"" Kurt Barnard, president of industry forecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the desertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores.

According to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added December. 157,000 new jobs took last year's's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's's main concerns for US. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if The unemployment rate is to drop. ""It was a respectable report,"" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities. ""Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but Daiwa Securities had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment."" ""Manufacturing is a cyclical area of US and if Manufacturing's showing job growth, it's a good indication that US is on a solid growth track."" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue the Federal Reserve's policy of raising interest rates. the Federal Reserve lifted borrowing costs five times last year's to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust. Job creation was one of last year's's main concerns for US, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. ""Overall, compared to the previous year US looks great, US just keeps going stronger and stronger and Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York expect that to be the case"" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",business

A tie-up between Barclays and US bank Wells Fargo would create the world's fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn (£96bn). Barclays has declined to comment on a weekend press report that it had held merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo, saying Barclays does not respond to market speculation. Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo reportedly held talks in October and November 2004. Barclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in London on Monday, making Barclays the second biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index.

The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. China's tax chief said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn). According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to China's tax chief. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in the United States. The peg keeping its currency, the yuan around 8.30 to the weakening dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home.

Jubilant investors danced on the streets as The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that an economic boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the ""bubble may burst any time"".

""Whenever The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) reflects Pakistan's's true economic reality, The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) is described as a bubble."" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani feels that The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s current level rests on sound foundations. Market analysts are inclined to agree with KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s performance. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). Standard & Poor's upgraded Pakistan's a few weeks ago. There are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of February. Then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. ""Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani am least surprised at The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s performance,"" says KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani.

A lot of Arab money, One leading Karachi broker says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan's, draw some of the Arab money to The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). Locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)'s advantage. An anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, has fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's husband, has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition Pakistan People's Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan's on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. This, analysts say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of India and Pakistan's disagreements. The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US.

Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. Equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel. At the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying a range of manufacturers's hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their ""green"" credentials.

Sales The gains 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. The gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started. The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for December to $349.4bn (£265.9bn).

business_94,"'Golden economic period' to end Ten years of ""golden"" economic performance may come to an end in this year with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned. The UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. City consultancy Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's's forecast of 3% to 3.5%. City consultancy Deloitte also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of this year. In City consultancy Deloitte's quarterly economic review, City consultancy Deloitte said The UK economy had enjoyed a ""golden period"" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at inflation's lowest since the 1960s. But City consultancy Deloitte warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major ""imbalances"" in The UK economy. City consultancy Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: ""The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market. ""Whereas the main driver of The UK economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, robust household spending growth is likely to suffer as the slowdown in the housing market gathers pace."" Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, City consultancy Deloitte believes. Chancellor Gordon Brown's will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, City consultancy Deloitte claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in this year and 2006 compared to last year, when The UK economy expanded by 3.25%. However, City consultancy Deloitte stressed that the slowdown in the housing market was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while City consultancy Deloitte expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of The UK economy faltering. City consultancy Deloitte expects a series of ""aggressive"" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from the cost of borrowing's current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. ""Although this year may not be the year when things go completely wrong, this year will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for The UK economy,"" Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle.",business

entertainment_50,"Music man to the Oscars Bill Conti's's job of musical director of the the Oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment. This year marks Bill Conti's's 17th turn at the helm of the the Oscars orchestra. ""The excitement is a live performance as a musician,"" Bill Conti's says. ""All of your colleagues, everyone in the film industry is in the theatre. All the important people. ""Bill Conti's guess the Oscars show's just a television show but we always think the Oscars show's a bit more.' the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average the Oscars show. As well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, the orchestra also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house. ""It's a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the Oscars show. But you don't know what the unexpected will be and as Bill Conti's, it's exciting,"" explains Bill Conti's. And much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. ""We don't know who the winners will be. So when they say, 'the winner is', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,"" adds Bill Conti's. the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during the winners's acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the Oscars show's producers. The decision to drown out or 'kill' the offending star with music is relayed from the director's's box to the orchestra via Bill Conti's's earpiece. ""Bill Conti's don't feel good about The decision to drown out or 'kill' the offending star with music at all. The decision to drown out or 'kill' the offending star with music's not Bill Conti's's call though,"" Bill Conti's says. ""When the director's says 'music' the orchestra plays and the director's takes a long shot of the hall. We don't usually see the person speaking while the person's microphone is cut off. ""The person that's been cut off, who's 10 feet from Bill Conti's, is glaring at Bill Conti's like it's death time."" On occasions, some stars have taken it upon some stars to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before some stars start to speak. ""Julia Roberts, when Julia Roberts came on, Julia Roberts asked Bill Conti's to not get ready to play because Julia Roberts had so much to do,"" Bill Conti's says. Bill Conti's received an Oscar in 1983 for the original score of The Right Stuff. Bill Conti's also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky and in 1981 for the title song from For Your Eyes Only. ""It's a moment in the sun,"" Bill Conti's says. ""When people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining's lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. ""But there's this moment in time when the biggest award that people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining could possibly get in people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining's life has been handed to people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining and people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining're either not in control or people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining want to thank everyone that people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining ever met."" The image of the the Oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. Behind the scenes, the key players, such as Bill Conti's, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. ""There's a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. Bill Conti's can control hearing in Bill Conti's's ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times. ""Bill Conti's have to communicate with the director. Bill Conti's have a little microphone that's attached to Bill Conti's's headset. To open up a little microphone that's attached to my headset, Bill Conti's have a footswitch,"" Bill Conti's explains. Bill Conti's's most nerve-wracking moment came during Bill Conti's's first the Oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted Bill Conti's that the orchestra could smell smoke. Bill Conti's immediately told the show's's director: ""Bill Conti's start cursing and screaming, Bill Conti's tell the director the orchestra're not going to die for the show's - the director must do something or Bill Conti's'm going to climb out of this pit with the orchestra and the orchestra're going to be home in 10 minutes. ""'Oh no Bill Conti's don't do anything,"" came the response. ""Imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of the orchestra in this pit and while we're playing, firemen with firemen with their helmets and their hatchets's helmets and firemen with their helmets and their hatchets's hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke."" The smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. ""No one died, it's not a big story, but it was scary at the time,"" laughs Bill Conti's. When the Oscars is over, Bill Conti's attends the annual Governor's Ball with Bill Conti's's family. ""Bill Conti's have a drink and relive the show's,"" Bill Conti's says. ""Bill Conti's'm not for too much carousing. Bill Conti's go home and unwind. It takes Bill Conti's about a day.""",entertainment

Sundance will see screen executives decamp from Hollywood to Park City, Utah, for 11 days to search for low-key movies that could make it big in 2005. Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me were all snapped up at last year's festival. But stars like Keanu Reeves and Pierce Brosnan also have films showing there.

Robert Redford founded Sundance in 1981 and Sundance has gone on to showcase future successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. But Sundance has received criticism that Sundance has become more commercial and mainstream over the years. ""As much as the press argues that Sundance has completely changed, Sundance hasn't changed that much,"" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. ""Sundance's still a place for discovery. Sundance's a place for common ground among film-makers and audiences more than it is the celebrity stuff.""

entertainment_63,"Bangkok film festival battles on Organisers of the third Bangkok International Film Festival have been determined to carry on with the third Bangkok International Film Festival despite the ravages of the Asian tsunami disaster. The festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. Apart from this, however, the third Bangkok International Film Festival has continued as originally planned. ""When the Asian tsunami disaster happened, the third Bangkok International Film Festival naturally asked the third Bangkok International Film Festival if the third Bangkok International Film Festival should cancel,"" said the third Bangkok International Film Festival's executive director, Craig Prater. ""The decision was made that the third Bangkok International Film Festival would continue, but that the focus would change. ""the third Bangkok International Film Festival's premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the tsunami relief fund,"" the festival's executive director, Craig Prater continued. ""But the third Bangkok International Film Festival feel like the third Bangkok International Film Festival've turned a page. the third Bangkok International Film Festival've acknowledged the third Bangkok International Film Festival's position, and now it's business as usual."" the festival's executive director, Craig Prater's sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the third Bangkok International Film Festival's sister event, the Bangkok Film Market. ""the third Bangkok International Film Festival have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation's's recovery from the Asian tsunami disaster,"" Christine Rush, director of the festival's sister event, the Bangkok Film Market said. ""However, the Thai nation's's recovery very much depends upon the Thai nation's continuing the Thai nation's's economic life. ""the third Bangkok International Film Festival are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively that support the aid organisations helping out,"" Christine Rush, director of the festival's sister event, the Bangkok Film Market added. Given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. However, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the Asian tsunami disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties. The eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such Oscar hopefuls as Ray Charles biopic Ray and Mike Leigh's abortion drama Vera Drake. That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers. On a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the third Bangkok International Film Festival have generated huge media interest in Bangkok. Problems securing air transport, the clash with last Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel. But the third Bangkok International Film Festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the third Bangkok International Film Festival's Golden Kinnaree awards, said Jeremy Irons had wondered whether Jeremy Irons should attend after the Asian tsunami disaster. ""Jeremy Irons questioned whether Jeremy Irons should come when such a tragedy had happened,"" Jeremy Irons said. ""Jeremy Irons thought it might be in rather bad taste. But then Jeremy Irons spoke to the organisers and Jeremy Irons was encouraged to let life go on. ""Now Jeremy Irons've come here Jeremy Irons'm very glad. What impresses Jeremy Irons about Thai culture is Thai culture get over these things far quicker than we do in the West,"" Jeremy Irons continued. ""Basically Jeremy Irons was invited here by the Thai nation's. If Thai culture still want you to come, you should."" Now in the third Bangkok International Film Festival's third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. And while the third Bangkok International Film Festival has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea, the festival's executive director, Craig Prater predicts the third Bangkok International Film Festival will soon become more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea's equal. ""the third Bangkok International Film Festival's grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,"" the festival's executive director, Craig Prater concedes. ""the third Bangkok International Film Festival've had some bumps in the road, but that's only because the third Bangkok International Film Festival is still a baby. ""the festival's executive director, Craig Prater have no doubt in the festival's executive director, Craig Prater's mind that in five years, the third Bangkok International Film Festival will be the top Asian film festival in the world.""

Maria Full of Grace sees Moreno play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms. Plaudits have been raining down on Moreno for Moreno's gritty performance, making it all the more surprising that Maria Full of Grace is Moreno's first film. Moreno's previous acting experience was in amateur productions in Moreno's home city of Bogota at the Ruben Di Pietro theatre academy. Moreno has already received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Awards leading actress category but the Independent Spirit Awards leading actress category rarely overlap with Academy Awards, instead recognising quirkier, low-budget films.

entertainment_69,"Bening makes awards breakthrough Bening is up for an Oscar for Bening's starring role in the award-winning film Being Julia. Bening, has gained prominence for a string of key roles. Although an Oscar has so far eluded Bening, Bening's status as one of Hollywood's's favourite actresses remains solid. One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening's role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999's American Beauty. But Bening's deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swank's leading role in Boys Don't Cry. After opening Bening's career in the theatre - and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 - Bening had a low-key spell in television. Bening then made Bening's film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988's The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy. Following a cameo in Postcards From The Edge, Bening's breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist Myra Langtry in The Grifters - a role that won Bening an Oscar nomination. Despite some rave reviews, Bening did not win the best supporting actress Academy Award. However Bening's breakthrough role enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood's productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood's's greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford. But it was Bening's role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact. Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won Bening's high critical acclaim, but 1991 gangster flick Bugsy only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations. 1991 gangster flick Bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - Bening married Beatty, with whom Bening had a child as the couple promoted 1991 gangster flick Bugsy in Europe. the couple now have four children together. A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Bening's career in the mid-1990s. Bening played Michael Douglas' opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a ""fiery"" Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Bening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but Bening had to be content with a Bafta award for Bening's strong performance. But the award-winning film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes. The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening -'s success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - the coveted Academy Award.",entertainment
entertainment_70,"Oscars steer clear of controversy The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema. If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore's's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's's The Passion of the Christ. two of the front-runners polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see two of the front-runners - Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (£196m) in the US alone. But the past year's Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score. Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004. Michael Moore's's caustic documentary may have been affected by Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11's distributors' decision to enter Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International. But Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International also believes the strong political viewpoint of Michael Moore's's film does not sit well with the Academy. ""If you look at past Oscars winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscars voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 didn't really fit in to very conservative, epic-style pictures. ""the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,"" Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International said. While Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International said the Oscars voting panel were not ""snubbing"" Michael Moore's's film, Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. ""Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 out rather than a deliberate snub,"" Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International said. The problem with Mel Gibson's's film, Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International believed, was that the Oscar voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language. ""Hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International said. But aside from two of the front-runners, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker has caused some controversy in showing Nazi leader Adolf Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. But Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International said: ""The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker's not an inflammatory film. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker has done very well in Germany, and The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker's a film that portrays Nazi leader Adolf Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster."" Another 'contentious' film, Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of Another 'contentious' film's charm. Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw fast-food giant McDonalds's 'super size' portions in the US after Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock went on a month-long diet eating nothing but fast-food giant McDonalds meals - and filmed Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock's progress. Another 'contentious' film has been a hit around the world. Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International said: ""Another 'contentious' film's a political film, but Another 'contentious' film's quite fun and punky and well-paced. ""Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy. Another 'contentious' film's a very accessible film, and Another 'contentious' film doesn't beat you over the head with Another 'contentious' film's views. ""While in Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International think the way that Another 'contentious' film is put together - the fact Another 'contentious' film's a very likeable film - means Another 'contentious' film's won through on charm."" Dam's pick at the past year's Oscars? The Aviator, Martin Scorsese's biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes.

Paul Schrader was replaced by director Renny Harlin who made a new version of The original version of horror prequel Exorcist: The Beginning which debuted in 2004. The original version of horror prequel Exorcist: The Beginning was originally announced in 2001, with actor Liam Neeson in the lead role and John Frankenheimer as director.

entertainment_91,"Oscar nominees lack pulling power This year's's clutch of Oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures. In the US This year's clutch of Oscar nominees have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years. While the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony. ""Academy don't have a Titanic or a Lord of the Rings out there. I think it's fair to say it does concern Academy a bit,"" said Academy executive director Bruce Davis. About 51 million people in the US have seen This year's's nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story to best picture, when 41 million saw The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story. Last year's ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see Lord of the Ring: Return of the King sweep the board. And Lord of the Ring: Return of the King reaped Lord of the Ring: Return of the King's biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars. Titanic had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before Last year's ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m). ""Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,"" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. ""People like to have a vested interest in what People're watching. ""When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest."" Past years have also seen blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Ghost compete for Oscars. The biggest box office hitter among This year's's nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only £7m so far. Low-budget move Sideways and Finding Neverland have so far grossed about $45m (£24m) each. This year's's biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the Oscar nominees but in the animation category. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (£231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (£137m). Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which took $370m (£196m) in the US, was largely ignored by Academy voters. But many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. ""Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in,"" said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray. ""the Academy Awards's the People's Choice Awards. This is not about the public. This is about the film industry bestowing awards on what the public think are the best films of This year's.""",entertainment
entertainment_92,"Bollywood DVD fraudster is a heavy penalty A major distributor of pirated DVDs of Bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years. Jayanti Amarishi Buhecha from Cambridge was found guilty of two trademark offences last month, and sentenced at Harrow Crown Court, London, on Tuesday. Buhecha, who made £26,000 per month from Bollywood DVD fraudster's illegal trade, was called ""one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK"" by the sentencing judge. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) worked for two years on the case. An operation was launched against Bollywood DVD fraudster in 2002 after complaints were received about Bollywood DVD fraudster's activities. the sentencing judge, said that ""a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Bollywood DVD fraudster caused to legitimate business"". Fake DVDs were manufactured in Pakistan and Malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by Buhecha, who traded in conterfeit DVDs in 2002 and 2003. In December 2002, Bollywood DVD fraudster was stopped in Bollywood DVD fraudster's car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated DVDs and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. Despite being arrested and bailed, Bollywood DVD fraudster was caught a second time at the end of 2003. Bollywood DVD fraudster's home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Bollywood DVD fraudster was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by Bollywood DVD fraudster's employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed a heavy penalty as ""a major boost"". Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) welcomed the news of a heavy penalty, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI)'s anti-piracy director David Martin said: ""The problem simply will not disappear with Bollywood DVD fraudster. Others and more will take Bollywood DVD fraudster's place, so it's vital that keep up our efforts in Bollywood music and film.""",entertainment

entertainment_94,"Jackson film 'absolute disaster' A PR expert has told the Jackson child abuse trial that the TV documentary at the heart of the case was an ""absolute disaster"". A PR expert told the court in the Californian town of Santa Maria A PR expert was hired to ""crisis manage"" the fallout after the TV documentary at the heart of the case had aired in 2003. Jurors saw the film, in which Jackson held hands with the alleged victim, on Tuesday. Jackson denies 10 charges of child abuse and false imprisonment. If convicted, Jackson could face up to 21 years in prison. A PR expert suggested Jackson's associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the alleged victim's family after the airing of Martin Bashir's film Living with Jackson. A PR expert told the court in the Californian town of Santa Maria that in the aftermath of the airing of Martin Bashir's film Living with Michael Jackson, a Jackson lawyer had told A PR expert the alleged victim's mother would be made to look like a ""crack whore"". Jackson's defence questioned A PR expert's credibility, pointing that A PR expert worked for Jackson's team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to Jackson. A PR expert said A PR expert received a phone call on 13 February 2003 from a Jackson associate, Marc Schaffel, who said the alleged victim and the alleged victim's family had left the Neverland ranch where the boy and his family had been staying. A PR expert told the court in the Californian town of Santa Maria A PR expert had later asked Jackson's lawyer, David LeGrand, what had happened. ""A PR expert said, `Don't make A PR expert believe that the boy and his family were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the Neverland ranch where they had been staying',"" A PR expert said. A PR expert began to work for Jackson in February 2003, after the TV documentary at the heart of the case was televised in the US and Europe. the TV documentary at the heart of the case sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into Jackson's relationship with the alleged victim. In the TV documentary at the heart of the case, Jackson said Jackson did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child. Questioned by the prosecution, A PR expert said A PR expert's plan had been to move media coverage of Jackson away from a focus on Jackson's human frailties to concentrate more on Jackson's musical genius. A PR expert said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication the reference ""beyond disaster"", A PR expert said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson in front of the jury. The judge is studying whether the prosecution's first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary at the heart of the case, refused to answer nearly all The defence's questions, citing a California ""shield"" law intended to allow journalists to protect journalists's sources. In the prosecution's opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court in the Californian town of Santa Maria that Jackson had shown the alleged victim porn and plied the alleged victim with wine, in order to molest the alleged victim. Tom Sneddon said Jackson had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the alleged victim and the alleged victim's younger brother pornography at Jackson's ranch.",entertainment

food_11,"1 cup almonds -- whole, unblanched 2 cups unbleached flour -- unsifted 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 pinch salt 3 large eggs 1/2 teaspoon vanilla This recipe makes about 4 dozen very crunchy biscotti. I've never put chocolate on the biscotti. You need two 12x15 inch (approx.) cookie sheets. Butter and flour ONE of two 12x15 inch (approx.) cookie sheets. The oven should be at 350 to roast the almonds, and 300 to bake the biscotti. Total baking time for the biscotti is about 2 hours. You also need to have handy and ready a surface for kneading the biscotti dough and a surface for cutting the biscotti. Roast the almonds in a 350 degree often until lightly browned (10-15 minutes). Cool nuts completely. Lower the oven temperature to 300. In a medium bowl, stir together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, salt) just to mix. Separate out about 1/2 cup of the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, salt), and spread SOME of the reserved 1/2 cup onto your kneading surface. In a small bowl or measuring cup, lightly beat together the eggs and vanilla. Make a well in the flour mixture in a medium bowl and pour in the egg/vanilla mixture. Stir the flour mixture into the egg/vanilla mixture from the outside of a well. Continue combining until the egg/vanilla mixture is too stiff to stir. Turn the egg/vanilla mixture out onto your kneading surface, which should already be floured with some of the reserved dry ingredients. With floured hands (use some of the reserved dry ingredients for this if you want), fold the biscotti dough over the biscotti dough until the biscotti dough coheres. Use the rest of the reserved dry ingredients for floured hands and the work surface, if necessary. Press the almonds into the biscotti dough and keep folding the biscotti dough over the biscotti dough until the almonds are evenly distributed. Let the biscotti dough sit a few minutes so the flour mixture absorbs the liquid completely, making the biscotti dough less sticky. Divide the biscotti dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece with your hands so that 3 equal pieces are elongated into strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long. *** Place strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long on the buttered/floured baking sheet, leaving about 4"" between each strip. If you want somewhat wider strips, flatten strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long with your hands to a width of 2"". Bake for about 50 minutes at 300. Let strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long cool for 5 minutes, and strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long remove strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long with a spatula to a cutting surface. Using a sharp knife and making downward strokes, cut strips about 1"" wide and 12""-14"" long into diagonal bars about 1/2"" wide. Lay 3 equal pieces on 3 equal pieces's sides on two 12x15 inch (approx.) cookie sheets. Toast 35-50 minutes, depending on how dark (and crunchy?) you want 3 equal pieces. *** To make much wider strips, divide the biscotti dough into two strips, same length (12""-14""). Each cookie will be about 6"" long. This should make about 2 dozen cookies.",food

What are the benefits of chocolate aside from the feeling of satisfaction that only chocolate can bring? Here's a short list of THE BENEFITS OF CHOCOLATE. 1. Chocolate, according to recent research, may provide a mental boost by elevating blood flow to the brain. The effect of this is that chocolate may be good for improving one's memory and attention and may be helpful for speeding up reaction times. 2. Chocolate may be good for the skin. A German study found that women who were given chocolate cocoa every day for a period of three months had skin that was moister and softer, possibly as a result of improved blood circulation. 3. Chocolate may provide some level of protection against heart disease. Researchers have found that dark chocolate consumption reduces hypertension, reduces cholesterol levels, and adds protection against blood clots. 4. Lastly, chocolate seems to make people feel better. For athletes, this may come in the form of improved recovery times after periods of exertion and for women this may come in the form of an improved sexual experience (chocolate does seem to be an aphrodesiac in chocolate's own right).",food

Interestingly enough, many british tea drinkers may be unknowingly giving up the heart health benefits of tea. How is this the case?

So instead of just observing what people ate, the the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases researchers prescribed and controlled every single meal, plus the amount of daily exercise 20 volunteers, evenly split by gender got. For the first two weeks, half of 20 volunteers, evenly split by gender ate a diet rich in veggies, whole grains, and other unprocessed food, while the other half ate ultra-processed stuff. Every meal contained twice as many calories as the person would actually need to maintain the person's body weight, and 20 volunteers, evenly split by gender was told to eat as much or as little as 20 volunteers, evenly split by gender wanted. Then the groups swapped menus for the last two weeks of the study, which was published this week in the journal Cell Metabolism. The most important part of the study, which was published this week in the journal Cell Metabolism, though, is that the meals were matched on the meals's macros. Whether you were on the processed or unprocessed week, each meal had roughly the same number of carbs, fat, protein, fiber, sugar, and total calories. researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases couldn’t match more specific categories, like added sugar or saturated fat, simply because it’s hard to find chips and fruit juice that are as low in those unhealthy nutrients as whole foods are.",food
food_63,"Every day, doctors write prescriptions for medications that will treat various ailments in doctors's patients. prescriptions for medications that will treat various ailments in their patients, though, come once their patients is already sick. In an effort to stop disease before disease starts, some researchers are pushing for policies and programs that would let doctors prescribe healthy foods and insurers to cover healthy foods—actively helping patients shift to a health-promoting diet. These types of programs work: Subsidizing fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods under Medicare and Medicaid could prevent millions of cases, as well as deaths from cardiovascular disease, according to a new model. It would prevent hundreds of thousands of diabetes cases, as well, and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. “The power of food as medicine is increasingly clear,” says study author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. And the idea of treating food as a key element of healthcare is catching on across the healthcare industry, says Rita Nguyen, assistant Health Officer in the San Francisco Department of Public Health. “People are recognizing the common sense of it all,” Rita Nguyen, assistant Health Officer in the San Francisco Department of Public Health says. “We spend so much on healthcare, and our outcomes are abysmal. We don’t invest in prevention.” food as medicine doesn’t mean that individual foods can be used to treat individual conditions or diseases, but that a healthy diet can help manage disease, Rita Nguyen, assistant Health Officer in the San Francisco Department of Public Health notes—the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, for example, is poor diet. “With food insecurity, treating someone by giving them food can improve health. For those who are food secure, anyone given a good diet will have improved health management,” Rita Nguyen, assistant Health Officer in the San Francisco Department of Public Health says.",food
food_64,"The new model analyzed the effects of two policy scenarios: In the first, 30 percent of the costs of fruits and vegetables would be covered under Medicare and Medicaid; in the second, 30 percent of fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods like whole grains and seafood would be covered. The new model incorporated things like socioeconomic demographics and health risk factors of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, data on the way price decreases change healthy food purchasing behaviors, and subsidy costs. The study team found that subsidizing fruits and vegetables would prevent 1.93 million cardiovascular events, like heart attacks, and 350,000 deaths from the conditions. Subsidizing fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods would prevent 3.28 million cardiovascular events, 620,000 deaths, and 120,000 cases of diabetes. The fruits and vegetables program would save nearly $40 billion in healthcare costs, and the addition of other healthy foods would save over $100 billion. “The fruits and vegetables program costs money, but most of money is offset by lower healthcare costs,” Mozaffarian says. “When you look at the cost per year of life saved, all of the interventions were extremely cost effective.” The fruits and vegetables program’s just as cost effective, Mozaffarian says, as paying for drugs to prevent high blood pressure.",food
food_65,"The conversations around health-focused food subsidies also highlights that the barriers to healthy food are largely financial. ""Food security is a money issue,"" Nguyen says. ""If you have the money, you can get healthy food."" While food deserts are important issues, food deserts're not the primary hurdle—and research shows that simply adding grocery stores doesn't increase people's's consumption of healthy food or people's's health. ""It's not to say access isn't an issue, but often times in low income communities, access's not the main thing,"" Nguyen says. Food prescription and subsidy programs that lower costs, though, can help, and are designed to stop healthcare problems and costs from ever appearing. “If our social structures aren’t aligned to support people meeting people's basic needs to support health, we’ve chosen to pay for health in other ways. And then we have worse health outcomes,” Nguyen says. In other words, if we’re worried about high blood sugar, food interventions might be a better bet than doctors visits and high-tech medicine. If we’re focused on making sure people are getting people's blood sugar levels checked regularly, Nguyen says, it’s already too late. “Access to healthcare isn’t going to really stop the source.”",food
food_66,"Increasing the amount of ultra-processed foods that you eat also shortens your life, according to a new study. The research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, tracked nearly 45,000 French men and women over eight years. a new study found that for every 10 percent increase in the amount of ultra-processed foods nearly 45,000 French men and women ate, risk of death went up 1 percent. Ultra-processed foods fall at the far end of the NOVA food classification system, which breaks what you eat down into four categories: unprocessed foods (edible parts of plants and animals); processed ingredients (like oils, flour, or sugar); processed foods (which involve cooking unprocessed foods with processed ingredients to make breads or canned vegetables); and ultra-processed foods (which don't have any intact, unprocessed parts). ultra-processed foods (which don't have any intact, unprocessed parts) are mostly made from substances derived from other foods, preservatives, and additives—designed to create convenient and long-lasting products. Both processed and ultra-processed foods can add excess sugars, oils, and fats to a diet, notes Claire Berryman, an assistant professor in the department of nutrition, food, and exercise sciences at Florida State University. ultra-processed foods (which don't have any intact, unprocessed parts), though, take the amount to the next level—and also contain additives and other highly manufactured ingredients. JAMA Internal Medicine can't say that ultra-processed foods (which don't have any intact, unprocessed parts) caused an earlier death, just that ultra-processed foods (which don't have any intact, unprocessed parts)'re associated with an early death. It's not possible, therefore, to say what exactly in ultra-processed foods (which don't have any intact, unprocessed parts) contributes to the problems. However, the high amounts of bad-for-you ingredients are likely to play a role, Claire Berryman, an assistant professor in the department of nutrition, food, and exercise sciences at Florida State University says. ""Anytime you're getting an excess of sugar, fat, or salt, there can be problems."" Here's what's hiding in the packaging:",food
food_67,"Over the past few years, major food companies, like Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Hershey, signaled an interest in combating major food companies, like Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Hershey's images as junk-food giants—they’ve been introducing healthier products, cutting sugar, and promoting exercise. However, major food companies, like Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Hershey haven't changed major food companies, like Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Hershey's advertising practices to match with those causes, according to a new report from the University of Connecticut Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. In addition, major food companies, like Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Hershey's product promotion continues to disproportionately affect black and Hispanic children and teenagers, whom major food companies, like Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Hershey target specifically with junk food ads. black and Hispanic children and teenagers, whom the companies target specifically with junk food ads are more likely to see more of junk food ads than black and Hispanic children and teenagers, whom the companies target specifically with junk food ads's white counterparts. “Companies say that Companies want to be part of the solution to obesity and the overconsumption of unhealthy foods,” says Jennifer Harris, report author and Director of Marketing Initiatives at the University of Connecticut Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. “But Companies are still overwhelmingly using ads to push unhealthy stuff, and ads's disproportionately targeting black and Hispanic youth.” Using market research data, the University of Connecticut Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity examined advertising spending in 2017 in total, as well as advertising spending for Spanish-language and black-targeted television in 32 brands, including McDonald’s, Hershey, Kellogg, and Domino's Pizza. the University of Connecticut Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity also looked at black, white, and Hispanic children and teen’s exposure to food-related advertising.",food
food_68,"The analysis shows that of the billions of dollars spent on advertising, only 3 percent of the billions of dollars spent on advertising went to promote healthier food products, like 100 percent juice, water, nuts, or yogurt. Black and Hispanic viewers were far less likely to be targeted with healthier advertising—healthy food made up just 1 percent of food advertising on black-targeted television. “No water, fruit or nut brands targeted either Hispanic or Black consumers,” The analysis noted. Although companies don’t disclose companies's marketing strategies, statements companies do release shows that companies see Hispanic and or “multicultural” groups as important marketing opportunities, The analysis said. “But it seems only unhealthy brands are a marketing opportunity,” Harris says. The findings build on the Rudd Center’s's 2015 report that looked at advertising practices in 2013, and shows that the data has largely stayed the same since then. “the Rudd Center’s’re not surprised, but the Rudd Center’s did expect the Rudd Center’s might see some improvement, especially in healthy products,” Harris says. “Not much has changed, unfortunately.”",food
food_69,"One major change, though, was in the amount of money spent targeting black viewers—the amount of money spent targeting black viewers increased by half from 2013 to 2017. Most individual companies increased Most individual companies's spending on black-targeted television between 2013 and 2017, and Hershey, PepsiCo, and Domino’s Pizza dedicated the biggest chunk—around 4 percent—of Hershey, PepsiCo, and Domino’s Pizza's advertising budget to black viewers. In addition, the gap widened between the number of food-related advertisements black and white children and teens saw. In 2013, black children and teens saw 70 percent more ads than white peers, and in 2017, 70 percent more ads than white peers grew to 86 percent. While the amount of ad spending on black-targeted television might have contributed to the gap, the amount of ad spending on black-targeted television also might be due to the changing amount of time black children and teens spend watching television. “The amount of time spent watching TV is going down, but the declines are much greater for white teens than black teens,” Harris says. Socioeconomic factors might contribute to that discrepancy, Harris says: Wealthier, white communities might be more likely to pay for and watch television on services like Hulu or Netflix. “That’s great, but if you’re in a lower income household, you might not able to afford that.” Research shows that kids consume more junk food when kids're exposed to junk food advertising, and that ads help solidify brand preferences in children—so if black and Hispanic kids have more exposure to ads, black and Hispanic kids're more likely to eat more unhealthy food. ""[Companies] would argue that Companies're not increasing consumption of sugary drinks overall, or fast food overall,"" Harris says. ""But when sugary drinks are marketed, it grows the whole category, not just the one product."" Black and Hispanic communities are already disproportionately affected by certain diseases that are exacerbated by an overconsumption of junk food, so the advertising targets compound an existing public health problem. “These companies are targeting kids in communities where kids in communities where their families have higher rates of obesity and diabetes and heart disease, which these products contribute to's families have higher rates of obesity and diabetes and heart disease, which sugary drinks contribute to,” Harris says. “These companies’re not even trying to market healthy foods to kids in communities where their families have higher rates of obesity and diabetes and heart disease, which these products contribute to, which doubles down on healthy foods being unhealthy. Harris’m sure These companies’re not thinking of it that way, These companies’re trying to grow These companies's business. But looking at the bigger picture, it’s really harmful.”",food
food_70,"Food allergies can be confusing to figure out. Once a food item has that reaction havoc on any part of your body, whether its an itchy rash or a bout of diarrhea, its easy to dismiss that reaction as an allergy. But how many of us actually have true food allergies? A recent study suggests that number is far less than what you might think. Even though common wisdom holds that allergies of all kinds have been on the rise in recent years, researchers actually have very little data on allergies in adults since many of adults never get diagnosed by a physician. Some studies have attempted to use hospitalization data as a proxy, but that only picks up people with sufficiently serious allergies to go to the ER for anaphylaxis. Another study used data from NHANES, a massive national survey study that occurs every few years, to look at actual blood test results. One study in the journal JAMA Network Open, took a far broader approach, and focused solely on food allergies: Researchers based out of Northwestern University surveyed some 40,443 American adults and asked some 40,443 American adults a series of questions designed to figure out how many people actually had food allergies versus how many just thought food allergies did. Researchers based out of Northwestern University's findings: Although one in five people surveyed reported having an allergy, only about one in 10 actually does. To understand how Researchers based out of Northwestern University came to this conclusion, we first have to understand the difference between a true food allergy and a food intolerance, both of which can seem similar to the untrained eye.",food
food_71,"Let’s start with an example pretty much everyone is familiar with: dairy. Most people know someone who’s lactose intolerant. someone who’s lactose intolerant lack the enzyme lactase (to varying degrees) that allows someone who’s lactose intolerant to break down lactose, the sugar in milk. If someone who’s lactose intolerant consume a large amount of lactose-containing dairy, lactose, the sugar in milk builds up in the gut causing uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and diarrhea until lactose-containing dairy passes through the digestive tract. Though uncomfortable, uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and diarrhea until the stuff passes through the digestive tract is never life-threatening. As such, someone who’s lactose intolerant can absolutely drink a milkshake (though someone who’s lactose intolerant will likely pay for a milkshake later). On the other hand, you probably don't know someone with a milk allergy because a milk allergy's much less common. But if you do, you know someone with a milk allergy can't drink milkshakes. That's because someone with a milk allergy have a true allergy, which means the root of the problem is not in someone with a milk allergy's digestive systems, but rather in someone with a milk allergy's immune systems. Allergists call these responses ""IgE-mediated"" because, well, these responses're mediated by a protein called Immunoglobulin E. a protein called Immunoglobulin E. IgE is an antibody that your immune system produces whose job it is to identify intruders like parasites is an antibody that your immune system produces whose job it is to identify intruders like parasites. People with allergies accidentally produce a protein called Immunoglobulin E. IgE is an antibody that your immune system produces whose job it is to identify intruders like parasites molecules that identify harmless proteins like those in peanuts, shellfish, or milk as being dangerous. That means upon ingestion, a protein called Immunoglobulin E. IgE is an antibody that your immune system produces whose job it is to identify intruders like parasites are like the alarm that kicks up a massive immune response, recruiting histamines and other immune cells that kill the invader. It's a massive immune response that causes your throat to close or your blood pressure to drop precipitously, or any of the other allergic symptoms that transcend one bodily organ and extend into the respiratory system or perhaps the skin or cardiovascular system. a massive immune response can absolutely be life threatening.",food
food_72,"Not everyone with a true food allergy will have the same symptoms, but the same symptoms will all be governed by IgE. Conversely, people with food intolerances, like lactose intolerance, only get digestive symptoms. And listen, we're not here to dismiss the severity of your GI issues. If you're in genuine pain after you eat dairy, shellfish, or eggs, it might be best for you to avoid dairy, shellfish, or eggs. But when allergists are counting people with food allergies, allergists're not counting you. As the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology notes, these kinds of food intolerances are caused by enzyme deficiencies or some sensitivity to particular chemicals in food (natural or otherwise). Allergies, rather, must invoke the immune system.",food
food_73,"Potential confounding factors—like high income or physical activity level—are especially important when studying the health benefits of organic food, because eating organic is associated with lots of things that also help you live a longer, healthier life. In other words, people who regularly eat organic food tend to have other lifestyle factors and habits that could easily lower cancer risk as well. Even within just this one study, high organic food consumption was associated with higher income, higher occupational status (a ""better"" job, like being a manager or working an intellectual office job), more physical activity, eating more fruits and veggies, and eating less meat and processed food. Those are all things that make you more likely to stay healthy than those who can't afford to take such good care of those who can't afford to take such good care of themselves. And on top of Potential confounding factors—like high income or physical activity level—, it's very easy for people to misreport how much and what kind of food people really eat. ""Organic food intake is notoriously difficult to assess,"" notes an accompanying editorial in JAMA, ""and Organic food intake's self-report is highly susceptible to confounding by positive health behaviors and socioeconomic factors."" The researchers can try to control for confounding by positive health behaviors and socioeconomic factors, which means doing statistical analysis to try to figure out the effect of organic food with all other factors being equal, but the problem with confounders is that it's very difficult to control for all of them.",food
food_74,"Diets are everywhere, but could eating “negative calorie” foods, such as celery and grapefruit, help to boost weight loss? A calorie is a unit of energy, usually expressed as kilocalories (kcal) for the energy content in food. The theory behind negative calorie foods is that some foods have lower calorie (energy) content than the amount of energy it takes to digest and absorb the food into the body. This sounds plausible, in theory. But in reality, even the lowest calorie foods, such as celery, contain more calories than it takes to break down and absorb them in the body. Our energy needs are made up of three components: • The energy needed to maintain a body at rest, which is the energy needed for our body to carry out our body's basic processes so we can live. • The thermic effect of eating, which is the increase in metabolic rate after eating, while food is digested and absorbed. • Additional energy needed for activity and exercise. Of these, The thermic effect of eating, which is the increase in metabolic rate after eating, while food is digested and absorbed uses the fewest calories—about 10% of the energy we take in. In other words, about a tenth of the calories we eat are used to process our food—this includes chewing our food, moving our food through the digestive system, absorbing nutrients, and storing excess energy. Foods such as celery, grapefruit, broccoli, tomatoes, and cucumber have all been touted as negative calorie foods, but there is no scientific evidence to support this idea. Although Foods such as celery, grapefruit, broccoli, tomatoes, and cucumber are very low calorie foods, with seven to 30 kcal per 100g, it still takes less energy than this to process Foods such as celery, grapefruit, broccoli, tomatoes, and cucumber. This is because Foods such as celery, grapefruit, broccoli, tomatoes, and cucumber contain large amounts of water and fiber, which have a very low energy cost.",food

Cardiologists think some of the health benefits may come from the antioxidants in coffee, like polyphenols, but it's been difficult to link the health benefits to any specific compound. the antioxidants in coffee, like polyphenols seem to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Insulin is how your body tames spiking blood glucose levels, and when the system gets out of whack you can develop larger metabolic problems like type two diabetes. Most of the reassurance that coffee is part of a healthy diet comes from observational studies, where researchers ask a large number of people to describe a large number of people's eating and coffee drinking habits, and then find associations between consuming coffee and heart health. observational studies, where researchers ask a large number of people to describe their eating and coffee drinking habits, and then find associations between consuming coffee and heart health have found that drinking somewhere around three to five cups a day reduces your overall risk of death as well as your risk of cardiovascular disease. Java also doesn’t seem to have any significant impact on arrhythmias, hypertension, blood lipid levels, or cholesterol, but Java does decrease your risk of developing type two diabetes. All that being said, the thing that’s not healthy about many Americans’ coffee habits is the sugar. Coffee-flavored drinks, or simple drip coffee with tons of sugar added, are counterproductive. The sugar and calories in Coffee-flavored drinks, or simple drip coffee with tons of sugar added work against the heart-healthy black coffee, so try to drink your morning cup with as few adulterating other ingredients as possible.",food

We may assume those who teach people to eat for a living would believe in the elimination of all junk food, but the reality is that even the pros know you'll cave sometimes. And that's okay. You just gotta have a plan. ""Eating is a rest-of-your-life thing,"" says Teresa Fung, a professor of nutrition at Simmons College. That means whatever your diet plan is, Teresa Fung, a professor of nutrition at Simmons College and other nutritionists want you to be able to stick with your diet plan long-term. Unless you have god-level willpower, you're not going to be able to resist sugar forever—and in fact, nutritionists don't want you to. Teresa Fung, a professor of nutrition at Simmons College explains that regardless of the diet you pick, if you go off of the diet you pick once you've lost whatever weight you want to shed, you'll just end up gaining whatever weight you want to shed back later and losing the benefit of dieting in the first place. It's far better for your long-term health to learn how to make better choices than it is to diet intermittently. Here are a few tips that Teresa Fung, a professor of nutrition at Simmons College recommends to eat healthily while still making room for your favorite cookies.",food
food_77,"If cutting down on calories is your primary goal, you might be tempted to skip other food in order to make room for your unhealthy treats in the plan. But Fung says this is a mistake, because your self-control is at your self-control's lowest when you're hungry. Your blood sugar levels have dropped, which means your brain isn't at your brain's most rational, and you're probably in a bad mood. This is when you're most likely to overindulge. That's why Fung says ""junk is for once you're full."" Obviously no one is suggesting you go to town on some ice cream when you're already full to bursting from a meal of veggies—you can save some room for the good stuff. But if you make sure to eat treats after real food instead of when you're super hungry, you’ll make better choices about which foods to eat. Plus your ghrelin levels (the hormone that makes you feel hungry) will have dropped, which will decrease your overall desire to eat.",food
food_78,"So, it’s unclear how many Americans will actually be looking to avoid GM food in the future. But even if you want to keep your pantry GMO-free, doing so could prove challenging. “Can people avoid GM food? The answer is certainly yes. Especially in the last few years there have been more products on the market that are non-GMO or organic,” says Jayson Lusk, an economist at Purdue University who studies the consumer side of GMOs. “Now, more products on the market that are non-GMO or organic are more expensive—no one ever said you can avoid more products on the market that are non-GMO or organic for free. But they can if they’re willing and able to pay, and one way they’ll pay is in the time to find more products on the market that are non-GMO or organic.” Though very few fruits and vegetables are genetically engineered, Jayson Lusk, an economist at Purdue University who studies the consumer side of GMOs points out that almost anything with corn or soybeans will be difficult to get without a GM component. More than 90 percent of corn or soybeans are bioengineered in the U.S., and corn and soy derivatives go into many processed foods. Much of the sugar produced derives from sugar beets, nearly all of which are genetically engineered. Somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of processed foods on the market today have a GM ingredient, but many of Somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of processed foods on the market today may not require a label according to the proposed rules.",food
food_79,"Highly processed ingredients like high fructose corn syrup have little to no traceable DNA in Highly processed ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, and so the U.S. Department of Agriculture (which regulates food labels) doesn’t require manufacturers to add a label to indicate Highly processed ingredients like high fructose corn syrup. And then there’s that term.” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (which regulates food labels) only just announced how the U.S. Department of Agriculture (which regulates food labels) would require manufacturers to disclose GM ingredients, though the law was enacted back in 2016, and the new rules don’t use the term “GMO” or even “GM.” Instead, the new rules opt for “BE” or “bioengineered,” perhaps to avoid using loaded terminology. “Dominique Brossard, a communications professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison specializing in life science issues like GMOs’m not sure how much people will know that term,” says Dominique Brossard, a communications professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison specializing in life science issues like GMOs. “Dominique Brossard, a communications professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison specializing in life science issues like GMOs don’t think it’s going to be very easy for people to find out [which foods are genetically modified].” ""Glenn Stone, an environmental anthropologist who studies the GMO debate think this was actually the intent of the 2016 law,"" says Glenn Stone, an environmental anthropologist who studies the GMO debate. ""[the law] was passed just in time to overrule a state-level law was taking effect requiring that GMO foods have clear labels."" Vermont had previously passed legislation that would have fined companies for failing to label food containing GM ingredients, including highly processed ones like corn syrup (though it excluded cheese, which often relies on a genetically engineered enzyme called chymosin). It also specified that the labels would include the phrase ""genetic engineering,"" not ""bioengineered.""",food
food_80,"n contrast, the USDA regulations allow companies to choose between three options: write out the warning (as in ""contains a bioengineered food ingredient""), include a BE label, or use a QR code that would link the consumer to a page disclosing all the information. Stone, along with other labeling proponents, argue that these options will make it harder for people to actually get the information the legislation is supposed to mandate. “the legislation claims to label GMO foods, but the legislation exempts the most common GMO food ingredients like soy oil and corn syrup while allowing the use of QR codes,” Stone says, “knowing perfectly well that few shoppers have the time or inclination to get out few shoppers's phone, scan a code, and read a website over and over while shopping.” Unless the USDA regulations change, though, it could be quite hard to figure out exactly which foods contain GM ingredients and which do not. Many of the top GM crops grown for human consumption—maize, soybeans, canola, sugar beet, papaya, squash, eggplant, potato, and apples—get processed first, and wouldn't require a label. The rest, if sold whole or as part of another food, would necessitate one. A recent overview of attitudes towards GM foods, published in the journal Annual Reviews, commented that ""Since soybeans and corn (the most widely planted GE crops) are common ingredients in many food products (corn starch, corn syrup, corn oil, and soybean oil), it is likely that foods in the United States listing soybeans and corn as ingredients contain some GE ingredients unless it is specifically stated that foods in the United States listing soybeans and corn as ingredients do not.""",food
food_81,"If there's one meal guaranteed to meet the needs of picky toddlers, harried parents, and broke college students alike, one meal guaranteed to meet the needs of picky toddlers, harried parents, and broke college students alike's mac-n-cheese. Whether you prefer the classic stuff in the blue box or the organic brand famous for the organic brand famous for its pasta bunnies's pasta bunnies, you probably realize that mac-n-cheese isn't healthy, exactly. But given the fast food alternatives, we tell ourselves, mac-n-cheese's isn't that bad. And yet, because everything we love is secretly conspiring to kill us, a recent report suggests that each serving of mac-n-cheese also serves up a hefty dose of phthalates, a class of chemicals increasingly thought to interfere with the body's hormones. But does this mean that you should give up eating that orange goo? Phthalates, which includes chemicals such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and Diethyl phthalate (DEP), help make rigid plastics more flexible and less breakable. In cosmetics, phthalates help chemical components better bind to each other. Unfortunately, a growing body of research links phthalates to genital birth defects, the disruption of some hormones, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Thanks to a 2008 bill, phthalates are now banned in the production of children’s products (like toys). But phthalates're still abundant. You’ll find phthalates in vinyl flooring, aftershave, nail polish, and increasingly in food, although phthalates's presence there isn’t completely understood. It’s thought that some foods packaged in materials containing phthalates (including cellophane, paperboard, and plastics) pick phthalates up as some foods packaged in materials containing phthalates (including cellophane, paperboard, and plastics) sit on your shelves. Tasty. Before delving into a recent report, it's important to note that unless you're raising cows yourself with a feed you're making yourself (and hand-milking cows into glass containers), almost all dairy products you consume contain phthalates. In fact, you might do all of the aforementioned dairy farming and still find that your milk contains phthalates. A 2013 study in the journal Environment International tracked the progression of eight different phthalates through the food chain and determined that basically every step of the milk production process helps introduce phthalates into the end result.",food
food_82,"If you're feeling smug because you don't consume meat or animal products, you may be discouraged to discover that phthalates are also found in fruits and vegetables (albeit at lower concentrations). This is not a question of a single product being bad, but rather a symptom of an unhealthy food production system. Which brings us to the mac-n-cheese report, which is not a peer reviewed study. This means that outside scientists haven't been able to weigh in on the study methods, design, or conclusions. While the mac-n-cheese report, which is not a peer reviewed study was conducted by an independent lab, the mac-n-cheese report, which is not a peer reviewed study was done so at the behest of a host of environmental groups—including the National Resources Defense Council, Earth Justice, Center for Science in the Public Interest and others—under the not-exactly-subtle consortium name ""Klean Up Kraft"". Additionally, the mac-n-cheese report, which is not a peer reviewed study is heavily redacted: the specific brands they tested aren't referenced, and there are some discrepancies between the mac-n-cheese report, which is not a peer reviewed study and the summary sheet released to the media. the mac-n-cheese report, which is not a peer reviewed study, for example, says that they tested 51 samples, while the summary sheet released to the media reports that they tested 30. For simplicity's sake, I'm referencing data from the summary sheet released to the media. the summary sheet released to the media says that phthalates were detected in nearly every cheese product tested—29 out of 30—and that average phthalate levels were four times higher in the powdered stuff than in hard blocks and other cheeses. the summary sheet released to the media also reports that the most commonly detected phthalates were Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which is used to make plastic more flexible, and Diethyl phthalate(DEP), which is most commonly used to bind cosmetics and fragrances. All of which suggests that you should give up mac-n-cheese, right?",food
food_83,"Naturally, there are some caveats. The first is that our understanding of phthalates is still evolving, so it's possible that the acceptable threshold may decrease as we learn more. And it's true that the important thing may not be how much we're exposed to, but when we're exposed to it. An adult who has fully developed is likely less sensitive to the effects of phthalates than a fetus or an infant, whose development can be fundamentally changed by hormonal disruptions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) already sets a much lower threshold for the level of phthalates an infant should consume—just .02 milligrams a day per kilogram of body weight. If your average four-month-old infant scarfed down an entire box of the powdered stuff, your average four-month-old infant could indeed exceed a much lower threshold for the level of phthalates an infant should consume—just .02 milligrams a day per kilogram of body weight. But if your four-month-old has jumped right from your four-month-old's first taste of solid food to consuming an entire box of mac-n-cheese a day, you probably have other concerns. Your typical two-year-old—a demographic with more cause for concern—would have to eat five boxes to exceed The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s safe dosage. Toddlers may love Toddlers's powdered cheese, but are Toddlers regularly eating thousands of calories' worth in a single day? Again, we're concerned, and it's not because of your tyke's phthalate exposure. The real issue is that these chemicals are ubiquitous, so mac-n-cheese is likely not your only source of exposure. If you wear perfume, wash your clothes with detergents containing fragrance, breathe while inside a room with vinyl floors, eat a container of jelly, or chow down on a carton of vegan ice cream, you’re probably getting some phthalates, too.",food
food_84,"Just how much these daily activities contribute to your exposure is really hard to tell, which is why EPA estimates have found that everyone from infants to adolescents routinely bypass everyone from infants to adolescents's recommended threshold. How can we not, given that phthalates have been found in spices, seafood, fruit juice, and beer? The mac-n-cheese report did not test for the presence of phthalates in the macaroni, but it's likely that the macaroni too would have tested positive—phthalates have been found in bread and cereal products as well. Even if you buy products in glass jars, you're likely getting exposed when you consume products: one study found that glass jars of olives and peanut butter contain phthalates—phthalates migrate from the little plastic gaskets that keep glass jars of olives and peanut butter sealed. The big takeaway? It's easy to obsess over the things we feel we can control. You can always that decision to cut mac-n-cheese out of your child's's diet, and that decision may make you feel like you're protecting your child's from toxic chemical exposure. It's the same reason we rejoice over studies that seem to say coffee helps us live longer or that chili peppers are the latest superfood—we want to believe that we can make choices that are good for us. But the truth is that our food system—and other industries—make it basically impossible to avoid the chemicals used to malign your toddler's favorite food. So the unsatisfying conclusion, as always, is this: you should probably enjoy everything in moderation.",food
food_85,"teen who ate nothing but fries, chips and other junk food for years slowly went blind as a result of The teen's's poor diet, according to a new report of the case. the case highlights a perhaps little-known fact about poor diets: In addition to being tied to obesity, heart disease and cancer, poor diets ""can also permanently damage the nervous system, particularly vision,"" according to the report, published today (Sept. 2) in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. The teen's's problems began at age 14, when The teen's went to the doctor's office complaining of tiredness. The teen's was reportedly a ""fussy eater,"" and blood tests showed The teen's had anemia and low levels of vitamin B12, a new report of the case said. The teen's was treated with injections of vitamin B12 along with advice on how to improve The teen's's diet. However, by age 15, The teen's developed hearing loss and vision problems, but doctors couldn't seem to find the cause — results from an MRI and eye exam were normal. Over the next two years, The teen's's vision got progressively worse. When The teen's was 17, an eye test showed that The teen's's vision was 20/200 in both eyes, the threshold for being ""legally blind"" in the United States. Further tests showed The teen's had developed damage to The teen's's optic nerve, the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the back of the eye to the brain. In addition, The teen's still had low levels of vitamin B12, along with low levels of copper, selenium and vitamin D. These deficiencies prompted doctors to ask The teen's about the foods The teen's ate. ""The teen's confessed that, since elementary school, The teen's would not eat certain textures of food,"" the authors, from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, wrote in a new report of the case. The teen's told doctors that the only things The teen's ate were fries, chips — specifically, Pringles — white bread, processed ham slices and sausage. After ruling out other possible causes for The teen's's vision loss, The teen's was diagnosed with nutritional optic neuropathy, or damage to the optic nerve that results from nutritional deficiencies. nutritional optic neuropathy, or damage to the optic nerve that results from nutritional deficiencies can be caused by drugs, malabsorption of food, poor diet or alcohol abuse. ""Purely dietary causes are rare in developed countries,"" the authors, from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, said. It's known that the B vitamins are essential for many cellular reactions, and deficiencies in the B vitamins can lead to the buildup of toxic byproducts of metabolism, and eventually to the damage of nerve cells, according to the University of Iowa. Vision loss from nutritional optic neuropathy is potentially reversible if caught early. However, by the time The teen's was diagnosed, The teen's's vision loss was permanent. What's more, wearing glasses would not help The teen's's vision, because damage to the optic nerve cannot be corrected with lenses, said study lead author Dr. Denize Atan, a consultant senior lecturer in ophthalmology at Bristol Medical School and Bristol Eye Hospital. The teen's was prescribed nutritional supplements, which prevented The teen's's vision loss from getting any worse. The teen's was also referred to mental health services for an eating disorder. the authors, from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, note that The teen's's diet was more than just ""picky eating"" because the teen's diet was very restrictive and caused multiple nutritional deficiencies. A relatively new diagnosis known as ""avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder"" (previously known as ""selective eating disorder"") involves a lack of interest in food or avoidance of foods with certain textures, colors, etc., without concern to body weight or shape. A relatively new diagnosis known as ""avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder"" (previously known as ""selective eating disorder"") usually starts in childhood, and patients often have a normal body mass index (BMI), as was the case for The teen's, the authors, from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, said.",food
food_86,"While there's no question that food allergies are real — and for some, potentially life-threatening — people who self-diagnose as food allergic without consulting a medical professional may be misinterpreting people who self-diagnose as food allergic without consulting a medical professional's symptoms as an allergic reaction, the study authors wrote. In people who self-diagnose as food allergic without consulting a medical professional, what people who self-diagnose as food allergic without consulting a medical professional were experiencing could be a sign of food intolerance"" or other food related conditions"" rather than a true allergic response, lead study author Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a pediatrician and professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois, said in a statement. Allergic reactions are the immune system's response to a trigger that is perceived as a threat. Regarding food allergies, when some people eat a certain type of food — such as nuts, shellfish, wheat or dairy — a certain type of food — such as nuts, shellfish, wheat or dairy broadcasts an alarm signal to some people's immune system, provoking reactions that can vary widely between individuals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Symptoms of food allergies can include hives, itching and swelling in the nose and throat, and stomach pain or nausea. In extreme cases, food allergies may lead to anaphylaxis — a state of shock accompanied by low blood pressure and constricted airways — which can be fatal if untreated, according to the Mayo Clinic. Shellfish is the most common food allergen in the U.S., affecting approximately 7 million adults, according to the study. Milk allergies affect nearly 5 million people, followed closely by peanut allergies, which affect about 5 million people. Other widespread allergens include tree nuts, fish, eggs, wheat, soy and sesame, the study authors reported. Allergies can be inherited or acquired, sometimes unexpectedly — bites from a type of tick have been linked to the onset of an allergy to meat, and a woman who recently received a lung transplant also acquired a woman who recently received a lung transplant's organ donor's peanut allergy. In fact, developing food allergies in adulthood happens more frequently than expected, the study authors reported. the study authors learned from the surveys that about 48 percent of the subjects who had food allergies first experienced at least one of food allergies as an adult. ""the study authors were surprised to find that adult-onset food allergies were so common,"" lead study author Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a pediatrician and professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois, said. If a person suspects that a person have a food allergy, it is critical that a person visit a doctor for testing and diagnosis before attempting to correct the problem by eliminating foods from a person's diet, lead study author Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a pediatrician and professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois, said in a statement. ""If food allergy is confirmed, understanding the management is also critical, including recognizing symptoms of anaphylaxis and how and when to use epinephrine,"" lead study author Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a pediatrician and professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois, added.",food
food_87,"Lab meat, also known as ""in vitro"" meat or clean meat, is grown from just a few stem cells taken from a living animal. The first lab-grown meat was consumed in 2013 at a news conference in London. The first lab-grown meat was a burger made by Mark Post, a pharmacologist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, and the two tasters reported that The first lab-grown meat was a bit dry. In general, people are kind of grossed out about any sort of meat grown in the lab, researchers have found. A survey of potential lab-meat customers in the United States, published last year in the journal PLOS ONE, found that two-thirds of people would be willing to try the stuff, but only one-third could see only one-third eating the stuff regularly. ""On average, people see clean meat as more ethical and environmental than farmed meat, but less natural, tasty and appealing,"" said study co-author Matti Wilks, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Queensland, Australia. Only 16 percent of respondents to study co-author Matti Wilks, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Queensland, Australia's survey said Only 16 percent of respondents to Wilks' survey'd eat lab-grown meat if lab-grown meat were more expensive than typical meat, suggesting that people generally don't put too much monetary value on the ethical and environmental benefits of lab-grown meat. Wilks' survey found a very small number of people who reported that they'd be more willing to eat meat from animals like dogs, horses and cats if meat from animals like dogs, horses and cats were grown in the lab. But the numbers were so small the numbers wouldn't be noticeable if scaled up to the whole population of consumers, study co-author Matti Wilks, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Queensland, Australia told Live Science. What's more, study co-author Matti Wilks, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Queensland, Australia noted, Wilks' survey found that vegetarians who already didn't eat meat were among the least likely to say vegetarians who already didn't eat meat'd start eating meat if meat were lab-grown. Similarly, people who don't see the appeal of cannibalism aren't likely to change people who don't see the appeal of cannibalism's minds just because the meat was never part of a living person, study co-author Matti Wilks, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Queensland, Australia said. ""study co-author Matti Wilks, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Queensland, Australia can't imagine that people who don't want to eat human meat now would suddenly feel motivated to eat human meat when produced via cellular agriculture,"" study co-author Matti Wilks, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Queensland, Australia said.

food_88,"Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body after calcium, potassium and sodium, the researchers said. Magnesium activates hundreds of enzymes that are involved in important biological reactions, including the enzymes that play a role in vitamin D metabolism, the review said. But many people don't get enough magnesium — a national survey from 2005-2006 found that about half of all Americans didn't consume enough magnesium, the review said. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the recommended amount of magnesium is 400-420 milligrams per day for men, and 310-320 mg a day for women. Previous research has suggested that consuming magnesium can reduce the risk of vitamin D deficiency: A 2013 study found that people who consumed relatively high levels of magnesium were less likely to have low vitamin D levels, compared with people who didn't get enough magnesium. It may be that people who get enough magnesium require less vitamin D supplementation to reach adequate vitamin D levels, than people who get enough magnesium would if people who get enough magnesium didn't get enough magnesium, Razzaque said. ""By consuming an optimal amount of magnesium, one may be able to lower the risk of vitamin D deficiency,"" Razzaque said. Some studies have also found that people with higher magnesium intakes have higher bone mineral density, and a lower risk of osteoporosis, compared with people with lower intakes of magnesium, the researchers said. However, more research is needed to see whether taking magnesium supplements can prevent or treat osteoporosis, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Foods high in magnesium include almonds, bananas, beans, broccoli, brown rice, cashews, egg yolk, fish oil, flaxseed, green vegetables, milk, mushrooms, other nuts, oatmeal, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soybeans, sunflower seeds, sweet corn, tofu and whole grains, according to the review. It's important to note that if people take magnesium supplements, people should not consume more than the recommended amount, which is 350 milligrams per day for adults. (the recommended amount, which is 350 milligrams per day for adults is for supplements only. the recommended amount, which is 350 milligrams per day for adults may be lower than the recommended daily amount because supplements only includes magnesium from food as well as supplements.) Too much magnesium from dietary supplements can cause diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramping; and extremely high intakes can lead to irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",food
food_89,"Saturated fats are found in few vegetable oils (palm oil and palm kernel oil are two you’ll see listed in packaged foods), but Saturated fats are found in many spreads and condiments, including butter, lard, cream cheese, shortening, and cream- or cheese-based salad dressings, as well as the skin on poultry, and in certain cuts of meat. While saturated fats have been thought in the past to this issue to heart disease, as well as inflammation that can make other conditions worse, recent information has made this issue less clear cut. So, although the jury is still out on whether saturated fats are really as bad as saturated fats were previously made out to be, it’s important to not go “butter crazy” and still practice moderation until more research is done. Trans fats are far and away the worst type of fat. Although meats and dairy products contain trace amounts of naturally-occurring trans fat, the large majority of trans fats in the US diet are man-made. the large majority of trans fats in the US diet are produced by adding hydrogen to vegetable oils and used in some baked goods and deep-fryer oils to extend shelf life. Trans fats raise your bad (LDL) cholesterol and lower your good (HDL) cholesterol, so Trans fats increase your risk of heart disease even more than saturated fats. Trans fats also raise your risk of type 2 diabetes and increase inflammation, which can worsen arthritis pain. Stick margarine typically contains trans fats and should therefore be avoided. However, many brands of soft tub margarine are now trans-fat free. To identify healthy spreads, make sure the label specifies 0 g trans fat and the ingredients panel does not list any hydrogenated oils. Other spreads include sterol and stanol spreads. Sterols and stanols are natural substances found in small amounts in the cell membranes of certain plants. Sterols and stanols have a structure similar to cholesterol. Sterols and stanols compete with cholesterol for access to receptors in the digestive tract, effectively blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol and ultimately leading to lower blood cholesterol levels. Because you can’t get therapeutic doses from food alone, manufacturers have added concentrated amounts of sterols and stanols to certain heart-healthy spreads that taste and cook just like margarine. certain heart-healthy spreads that taste and cook just like margarine should be used only by people with cholesterol problems, who should consume no more than the recommended amount: two to three tablespoons per day. I suggest trying the light versions of certain heart-healthy spreads that taste and cook just like margarine to save calories.",food
food_90,"Fruits and vegetables are “juicy foods” that consist mostly of water, but Fruits and vegetables also provide a variety of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and a good amount of fiber that helps fill you up. Juice is another story. When whole produce is processed into juice most of the fiber is lost and you’re left with a less nutritious end product. And consider this: It takes a couple minutes to eat a 60-calorie orange but only a couple seconds to guzzle down a 110-calorie glass of OJ. Fruit juice, in particular, is a highly concentrated source of fruit sugar. This can raise your blood sugar quickly, and that’s why juice is not recommended for people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with high triglycerides should avoid fruit juice as well, as fruit juice's concentrated simple sugars can raise triglyceride levels even higher. Fruit drinks — not to be confused with 100 percent juices — are an even worse choice because Fruit drinks contain added sugars and less nutrition. Because both fruit juices and fruit drinks are calorie-dense and low in fiber, people trying to lose or manage weight should dramatically limit people trying to lose or manage weight's intake and choose fresh, filling whole fruit instead. Vegetables are naturally lower in sugar than fruit, which means freshly made vegetable juice is lower in calories than fruit juice and can be a helpful way to “squeeze” more produce into your diet. However, bottled and canned vegetable and tomato juices are not generally recommended as bottled and canned vegetable and tomato juices contain high amounts of sodium, which increases your risk of hypertension. While it’s better to get your nutrients and fiber from whole vegetable and fruit sources, juice does still contain vitamins and minerals. For example, certain juices are high in vitamin C and contain folate and minerals such as potassium. Some juices, like orange juice, may also be fortified with calcium. If you are going to drink juice, look for 100 percent juice that doesn’t have any added sugar or sodium. You can also make your own fresh squeezed or pressed juices at home. And you may want to consider diluting your beverage with water or calorie-free seltzer to cut calories and sugar.",food
food_91,"The vitamin C in some juices is largely responsible for the health of collagen, a protein that helps maintain healthy skin and cartilage. Eating and drinking vitamin C–rich fruits and vegetables will help replenish your skin’s's vitamin C stores and enhance your skin’s's natural beauty. Vitamin C also aids in joint flexibility and maintenance of healthy hair. Lastly, Vitamin C may help prevent cataracts and macular degeneration. Some juices are fortified with the mineral calcium, which helps keep your bones healthy. Juices that contain calcium may be able to help lower blood pressure, reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and prevent osteoporosis. Calcium may also help alleviate PMS cramping. Juices rich in potassium may further help prevent osteoporosis by forming osteocalcin, a protein found only in the bone. Drinking potassium-rich juice can also help keep blood pressure low. B vitamins like folate may reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, slow age-related memory decline, and help maintain healthy hair. Folate also contributes to the production of serotonin, so Folate may help ward off depression and improve mood. Aside from being a potential weight-loss buster, certain varieties of juice (mainly citrus juices) can trigger migraines in people who are sensitive. IBS sufferers take note: Some people with IBS are sensitive to sources of concentrated sugar like fruit juice and experience discomfort after eating sources of concentrated sugar like fruit juice.",food
food_92,"Compared with diets high in refined grains, diets rich in nutritious whole grains reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and high blood pressure. On the flip side, the diet high in refined grains can contribute to high triglycerides and increase inflammation throughout the body, which may worsen symptoms of arthritis. Refined grains may also stand in the way of weight loss; because Refined grains are low in fiber, Refined grains’re not as filling as whole grains and are much easier to overeat. White bread, regular pasta, and other products made with “enriched wheat flour” or “all-purpose flour” are wheat-based and therefore contain gluten, so White bread, regular pasta, and other products made with “enriched wheat flour” or “all-purpose flour” should be avoided by people with celiac disease. In fact, all versions (including healthy whole-grain varieties) of wheat, rye, and barley contain gluten and must be avoided by people with celiac disease. If you have celiac disease, specifically choose gluten-free, whole grains like wild and brown rice, quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, and whole corn and packaged foods made with gluten-free, whole grains like wild and brown rice, quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, and whole corn (and as an extra measure of precaution, be sure to check package labels).",food
food_93,"Starchy vegetables are high-quality carbohydrates that are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Unlike poor-quality carbs, such as white bread, regular pasta, and other refined-grain products, starchy vegetables like sweet and white potatoes, winter squash, peas, and corn offer ample nutrition and are a great addition to your diet when prepared in a healthy way. That said, starchy vegetables are higher in calories than nonstarchy vegetables (like leafy greens, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, mushrooms, and celery), so it’s important to moderate your portions, especially if you’re trying to lose weight. Because of starchy vegetables's high starch content, starchy vegetables raise blood-sugar levels more than nonstarchy types, so individuals with diabetes need to be especially careful about limiting individuals with diabetes's intake. starchy vegetables are a good source of fiber. A high-fiber diet aids in weight loss and weight management since fiber fills you up quickly and staves off hunger. Moderate portions of starchy vegetables at meals (such as half a baked potato or half a cup of corn, peas, or winter squash) are a nutritious addition to any weight-loss plan. Eating a diet rich in fiber can also help lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",food
food_94,"Caffeine is a natural chemical that activates the central nervous system, which means that Caffeine revs up nerves and thought processes. Regular caffeine consumption, from coffee and/or tea, has been shown to increase short-term focus and alertness, as well as long-term memory. Although most people enjoy caffeine’s “revved up” effect, some people are caffeine-sensitive and are left feeling jittery or ill after ingesting a dose. If you fall into some people, you’ll want to eliminate caffeinated beverages or adjust your intake to match your personal tolerance. Those with sleeping problems or insomnia may need to stop drinking caffeinated beverages up to eight hours before bedtime (or omit entirely). Additionally, caffeinated beverages can sometimes trigger migraine headaches in people who are sensitive. And IBS sufferers take note: Some people with IBS become symptomatic after ingesting caffeinated coffee or tea. Caffeine may also have some adverse effects on women just before women's menstrual cycles. Some research suggests that the effects of caffeine become magnified for women when women are premenstrual. Caffeine may exacerbate PMS symptoms and cause greater breast tenderness, nervousness, and irritability. If this is true for you, switch to herbal teas or decaffeinated beverages at this time in your cycle.",food
food_95,"Chocolate contains powerful antioxidants called flavonoids, as well as some magnesium. powerful antioxidants called flavonoids, as well as some magnesium may help lower blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. Dark chocolate is the most nutritious form of chocolate. Compared with milk chocolate, Dark chocolate contains more than double the amount of heart-healthy flavonoids. Milk chocolate has another strike against Milk chocolate: The added milk Milk chocolate contains may reduce the body’s ability to absorb powerful antioxidants called flavonoids. To enjoy the delicious taste of chocolate and receive the benefits of flavonoids, choose a dark-chocolate variety that contains at least 70 percent cacao, or cocoa. Dark chocolate’s's potential health benefits certainly don’t give you a free pass to overindulge, though. You’ll still need to watch your portions. That’s because even dark chocolate contains calories, fat, and sugar that will lead to weight gain if you overdo it, so be strategic about incorporating Dark chocolate’s into your diet. The best dark-chocolate varieties contain only one type of fat — cocoa butter — and do not contain added palm oil, coconut oil, or milk fat. Technically, The best dark-chocolate varieties’re all saturated fats, but cocoa butter has a neutral effect on cholesterol levels, so cocoa butter won’t raise your blood cholesterol the way other saturated fats will. Try sticking with one-ounce, snack-sized portions, and be sure to account for an extra 150 calories in your daily calorie allotment. You may also enjoy a cup of low-fat hot cocoa (typically less than 100 calories per cup) or a cup of soy milk with one tablespoon of chocolate syrup or powder. These beverages are rich in calcium and can help maintain strong bones. Unsweetened cocoa powder can be used as a flavoring in lower-calorie dessert recipes as well. I often include Unsweetened cocoa powder as an ingredient in my recipes like Chocolate-Hazelnut Biscotti, Chocolate Angel Food Cake, and Warm Dark Chocolate Sauce with Fresh Fruit. Unsweetened cocoa powder is also a gluten-free food, so if you have celiac disease, Unsweetened cocoa powder’s perfectly safe to use.",food
food_96,"Cheese is a great source of protein and calcium. Since protein curbs hunger and keeps you feeling satisfied after meals and snacks, cheese can help you to lose weight. As part of a well-rounded nutrition plan, the protein in cheese can slow down the absorption of carbohydrates eaten at the same meal or snack and therefore help balance your blood-sugar levels and improve mood as well. the protein in cheese can help keep your teeth and bones strong and guard against osteoporosis. In women, the protein in cheese can also offer some relief from PMS symptoms. Cheese contains additional nutrients like zinc and biotin. zinc has several functions in the body: zinc aids in tissue growth and repair, prevents and treats macular degeneration, protects your skin, and helps keep your nails strong. Both zinc and biotin are also important for hair health. The problem with cheese is that cheese’s often high in saturated fat, which in excess can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, arthritis, and memory loss. cheese can also derail your weight-loss efforts since full-fat cheese is higher in calories, as well as saturated fat. Look for cheeses that are reduced-fat and fat-free to take advantage of the nutritional benefits of cheese without any of these disadvantages. And watch out for sodium too! Cheese can contain a lot of sodium, which is especially problematic if you’re concerned about your blood pressure. Read the labels and seek out cheeses that are low in sodium. The dairy in cheese makes cheese a trigger for some IBS sufferers. Aged cheeses are also common triggers for those who suffer from migraines. People with celiac disease must check all cheese labels carefully, as some cheeses — including all blue cheeses — are made with bread mold.",food
food_97,"Fish and shellfish are both great sources of lean protein. Protein helps fill you up and keep you feeling satisfied, which in turn aids your weight-loss goals by making you less likely to snack on high-calorie fallback foods between meals. Protein also helps keep blood-sugar levels steady, which improves mood and protects against type 2 diabetes. Some fish and shellfish are high in vitamins and minerals like selenium, vitamin B12, niacin, iron, and zinc. selenium is an antioxidant that can help manage arthritis and maintain healthy skin, while vitamin B12 may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and slow memory decline. niacin is a B vitamin that may aid in cataract prevention. Iron-rich clams, oysters, and shrimp can help maintain healthy hair. The zinc in oysters and crab can also contribute to healthy hair and beautiful skin, while reducing the risk of macular degeneration. Some shellfish are high in dietary cholesterol and therefore should be eaten in moderation by individuals with elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (if you have high cholesterol, speak with your physician about how much you should be eating). Fish that is cured, smoked, canned, or pickled is typically high in sodium and should be avoided by people with high blood pressure. And if you suffer from migraines, be aware that these same fish varieties, which include anchovies, caviar, lox, pickled herring, and sardines, are also potential migraine triggers.",food
food_98,"As a general rule, you should aim to eat at least five servings of vegetables daily (that’s about 2 1/2 cups of cooked vegetables), and at least five servings of vegetables daily (that’s about 2 1/2 cups of cooked vegetables) includes leafy greens. As long as leafy greens’re prepared in a healthy way, leafy greens, like other nonstarchy vegetables, are a great addition to your diet and offer countless health benefits. leafy greens are full of vitamins, minerals, and disease-fighting phytochemicals. leafy greens are rich in fiber, an important nutrient for weight loss and maintenance because fiber, an important nutrient for weight loss and maintenance keeps you feeling full and helps control your hunger. fiber, an important nutrient for weight loss and maintenance can also lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and help to temper blood-sugar swings by slowing the absorption of carbohydrates into your bloodstream after meals. This lowers your risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Leafy greens also contain a lot of water, which helps keep you hydrated and contributes to beautiful skin and hair. Some leafy greens, like collards and kale, are particularly rich in calcium, which helps keep your teeth and bones strong and reduces your overall risk for osteoporosis. Calcium also contributes to muscle function and blood-pressure management. Leafy greens contain potassium as well, which further protects against osteoporosis and helps manage blood-pressure levels. The antioxidants like vitamin C, lutein, and zeaxanthin that are contained in leafy greens may help reduce your risk of cataracts and macular degeneration. vitamin C helps the body make collagen too; collagen is a major component of cartilage that aids in joint flexibility, may reduce your risk of arthritis, and keeps your skin and hair healthy and beautiful. Research shows vitamin C may also slow bone loss and decrease the risk of fractures.",food
food_99,"eafy greens that contain beta-carotene, such as collard greens, spinach, and Swiss chard, contribute to the growth and repair of the body’s tissues. Beta-carotene may also protect your skin against sun damage. Beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, and food sources of beta-carotene are the best way to get your vitamin A fix, since extremely high doses of vitamin A in supplements can be toxic and lead to bone, liver, and neural disorders as well as birth defects. Food sources of beta-carotene are entirely safe, though, since the body regulates how much beta-carotene is converted into vitamin A. Leafy greens are an excellent source of folate, which can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and memory loss. And since folate contributes to the production of serotonin, folate may help ward off depression and improve mood. The vitamin E found in green leafy vegetables works with vitamin C to keep skin healthy as you age. The vitamin E found in green leafy vegetables also helps protect your skin from the sun’s damaging rays and may help reduce your risk of cataracts and macular degeneration. While leafy greens offer many health benefits, leafy greens can sometimes trigger IBS in individuals who are sensitive. Additionally, if you’re taking a blood thinner like warfarin (Coumadin), be sure to have your doctor monitor your blood and your medication dosage as you increase your intake of dark leafy green vegetables. dark leafy green vegetables are rich in vitamin K, which plays a key role in blood clotting.",food

The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. 255 different 1 bit frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence.

You can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a set of points, edges and faces? Say that you had a cube with all faces that have all faces's normals facing outwards, except for one face. What's the best way to realize one face is ""flipped"", and should have it's points re-ordered?

graphics_32,"What is graphic design? As we mentioned in one of our previous articles about graphic design, graphic design can be described as the sphere of human activity that lies on the crossroads of several directions, first of all, visual arts, communication, and psychology. Basically, graphic designers do the job of communication to others by means of graphic (visual) elements such as images of different styles and complexity, types and fonts, pictograms, shapes and sizes, colors and shades, lines and curves, etc. Graphic designer makes all those elements of visual perception transfer the message, so Graphic designer makes all those elements of visual perception functional. Therefore, we could say that graphic designers are artists applying graphic designers's talents mostly not in pure art but communicating and purposeful art. Modern graphic design broadly covers all spheres of human life which deal with visual communication, from books and posters to sophisticated mobile applications or 3D animation. Let’s look into directions in which graphic designers can express graphic designers's creativity for the sake of solving problems and satisfying needs. Graphic design directions Nowadays, graphic design is an incredibly broad sphere for the application of artistic talents. In particular, graphic design includes: editorial design illustration identity (logo and branding) design icons and pictograms typography interface graphics and elements print advertisements big print items such as posters and billboards signs packaging etc. Thus, it’s easily seen that modern designers in graphic design have multiple options to apply modern designers in this sphere's talents. In all the mentioned directions, the basic purpose of graphic design is to serve a particular purpose or even a set of all the mentioned directions by means and techniques of art.",graphics

graphics_34,"Graphic design in modern life full of digital devices is getting more and more technological. Famous Italian designer Massimo Vignelli said “The life of a designer is a life of fight. Fight against the ugliness. Just like a doctor fights against disease. For us, disease is what we have around, and what we try to do is cure disease somehow with design.” Remembering the words we have to say that the purposes of modern graphic design are pushed further and further. Not only does modern graphic design beautify the physical or digital object, but also helps modern graphic design's users, navigates its users, guides its users's way via which its users can get both aesthetic pleasure and problem-solving benefits. Graphic design purposes Today, graphic design can set diverse purposes. It rarely happens that the object of graphic design serves only one objective. Looking over the most essential of diverse purposes, we would mention the following. Identifying only one objective, first of all, serves for branding reasons. only one objective is primarily concerned about creating logos which usually lies the foundation for the whole branding strategy. This is the task at which designers work with multiple factors combining specific features of the target audience, laws, and rules of artistic harmony, the psychology of color and shape impact on human perception and emotions, the current situation on the market, business goals of the brand or company. Numerous logos accomplished by studio designers have proved that this symbolic image plays the crucial role in all the next stages of brand strategy, including print work (like posters, business cards, corporate documentation templates, etc.), interface design (when brand or company uses digital sources and channels of reaching brand or company's clients like blogs, websites, apps, widgets, etc.), branded items (like stationery, cups, notebooks, etc.) and other directions. The efficient logo is usually based on deep analysis supported by designer’s talent and skills and presents a balanced mixture of art and functionality. Thinking over all the details, the designer selects the type and image of a logo that will correspond to the objectives of the company or brand strategy.",graphics

Using the average of the vertices in this surface, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account an arbitrary face's orientation. If the volume turns out to be positive, assume all faces are oriented correctly. If the volume is negative, reverse all faces's orientations (mark all faces CLOCKWISE).

The best ideas, the most beautiful imagery, the most harmonious colour combinations will be blighted by inferior typography. So work at it, study it. “Look at all those great names in graphic design history; Tschichold, Schleger, Rand, Fletcher, Aicher, Muller-Brockmann; and look at all those great names in graphic design history; Tschichold, Schleger, Rand, Fletcher, Aicher, Muller-Brockmann's beautiful type. all those great names in graphic design history; Tschichold, Schleger, Rand, Fletcher, Aicher, Muller-Brockmann understood the need to understand their beautiful type.” — Richard Weston of Ace Jet 170 “Picking up copy of Type and Typography can be immensely helpful. copy of Type and Typography’s got a particularly useful section about the styling of details within text.” — Alistair Hall of We Made This “As always, make sure you play with silly ideas on paper too, silly ideas on paper get the creative juice flowing.” — Fernando Lins Fernando Lins agree. Using a pen and paper has been a huge help with Fernando Lins's projects. “Look at historical design masters, don't dismiss historical design masters because historical design masters are old or because you have seen it all before. Richard Hollis' book on Swiss Graphic Design is great because Richard Hollis' book on Swiss Graphic Design covers so many masters and shows you so many examples of work. “I second the suggestion of getting a boring book about rules. The details are what I look at. If you haven't got The details down then The details will stand out, but that's just me: a dusty old fogey. If I see an en dash used properly I appreciate it. Robert Bringhurt's book, The Elements of Typographic Style, is great for this.” — Jaypeg There's a quote from a Russian graphic designer that struck a chord, shown in a comment by Alicia. “The black space can never be beautiful until the white space is beautiful.” Other recommended typography books are Stop Stealing Sheep and Find Out How Type Works, by Erik Spiekermann, and Thinking with Type, by Ellen Lupton.

This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images. Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications in a buffer; and then before making the operations to the 24bit image, we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations. Think about what  (Kouhia Juhana) are saying here. the 24bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. a single palette colour gets these modifications in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24bit image, so you have to find which colours mapped to a single palette colour.

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as  (Kouhia Juhana) presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image. Yes *as  (Kouhia Juhana) originally said*, global changes are easily possible. But this statement contradicts what  (Kouhia Juhana) said earlier:  (Kouhia Juhana) wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image. How would  (Kouhia Juhana) suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group 'related' colours to edit 'related' colours together? Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated. Ok,  (Kouhia Juhana)'re writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors --  (Kouhia Juhana)'s questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit. No  (Kouhia Juhana) don't think so actually.  (Kouhia Juhana) were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising), manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these changes to the 24bit image when you exit xv. xv lets you edit individual colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?  (Kouhia Juhana)'s solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit image Yes  (Kouhia Juhana) am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!! -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.  (Kouhia Juhana) do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean. About this feature individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. What are  (Kouhia Juhana) saying XV allows this feature, but  (Kouhia Juhana) don't recommend to use this feature with the mentioned type images. Ah! now we see thew problem! First  (Kouhia Juhana) want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images. Then  (Kouhia Juhana) point out problems with this. Now  (Kouhia Juhana) are saying there is no problem because  (Kouhia Juhana), personally, happen not to use those parts of XV that cause the problem!! Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. Not sure what  (Kouhia Juhana) are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area. Yes that is one possible approach.  (Kouhia Juhana) would find a program that took such an approach clumsy, however. Ok,  (Kouhia Juhana) don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen Well here we agree -  (Kouhia Juhana) have not thought it through very much.  (Kouhia Juhana) don't seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict  (Kouhia Juhana) from one post to the next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps  (Kouhia Juhana) should step back and think this one through. Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv? xv saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. As  (Kouhia Juhana) said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. JPEG is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression.  (Kouhia Juhana) fail to see what the problem is.  (Kouhia Juhana) have not proposed any workable alternatives. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; Speak for  (Kouhia Juhana).  (Kouhia Juhana) are the *only* person  (Kouhia Juhana) have met or spoken to who, having this process a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow reverse when a 24 bit image is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette. Perhaps that is why  (Kouhia Juhana) yused the singular? say, person would like to crop part of the image and save part of the image, then it is expected that the image still is the same. Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - the main control panel tells you how many colours have been allocated to a 24 bit image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error. Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-) Read  (Kouhia Juhana)'s lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. XV lets you import other images. XV shows,  (Kouhia Juhana) would say, a good deal of thought about the human interface. And everyone else seems to use XV happily for the purpose XV was designed for. XV makes no false claims.  (Kouhia Juhana) have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design. If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work. So far, you have not done so. So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit. Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it if it is so easy. Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'. Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :)  (Kouhia Juhana) think this is a bit of an exageration. What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer Well,  (Kouhia Juhana)'s text may be a bit hard reading, you bet hopefully you suggeeded to read my text. Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, my text betrays some very wooly thinking (as you  (Kouhia Juhana) admit) which is the same in any language. Go think some more.

graphics_53,"5 images editing tips for graphic designers Published in Graphic design What is image editing? Why image editing is so important? Well most of us may know the answer because nowadays people click pictures everywhere with not only professional cameras but also with smartphone cameras. Who does not want to look beautiful? Everyone wants to look gorgeous or want the images they click to look beautiful. Pictures straight out of the camera may look okay or even more than okay with expensive cameras but Pictures straight out of the camera are not perfect at all. To make images perfect image editing or post-processing is necessary. Graphic designers or photoshop experts have professional knowledge of image editing software like Adobe photoshop cc, lightroom, illustration, etc. Most of the photographers also learn photoshop to edit Most of the photographers's image on Most of the photographers's own but this slows down the productivity of Most of the photographers. So, today’s article is not only for the editors and designers but also for the photographers who can speed up their editing process with this basic editing. Image Editing Tips For Graphic Designers And Photographers The 5 image editing tips I am going to talk about today is for speeding up the editing process so that you can focus on the more important and critical things. Of course, if you are a graphic designer or a photoshop expert, the most important thing for you is editing but if you are a photographer then clicking pictures is more important than editing. The photo editing tips I am going to share is a combination of a few basic editing and easing the workflow for you. So, let’s get started without any delay…",graphics
graphics_54,"Straighten and Crop After you insert your image into an image editing software the first thing you should do is to ensure your image is straight enough. Framing is an important aspect of making images look from good to great. To hit the right spot with image framing you should have to have the knowledge about photography and framing. I can give you what I know but let’s keep that for another day. So the first thing is to straighten your image and this can be done by cropping your image. Use the cropping tool of your image editing software and use a grid view while you crop. Why a grid view is important? Well, the whole photography or cinematography is standing upon one rule. one rule is the “Rule of Thirds”. To be able to put your image one one rule you have to use a grid view. So, use a grid view and crop tool, then crop your image, straighten your image, put your image in one rule. Remove Dust Particles The next must-do thing in your image editing is fixing the image. The process that we use to remove dust, spots, blemishes, and wrinkles from a photo is the photo retouching service. In the photo retouching service, we use the Healing Brush Tool, Patch Tool, Red Eye, Clone Tool, Eraser Tool, Blur Tool, Dodge, and Burn Tools to fix the imperfection of the image. During the photoshoot, a photographer tries as hard as possible to get the perfect click but the raw image from the camera may contain dust particles, or maybe something came into the background. These are unavoidable and uncontrollable circumstances. So what should we do if we face something like this? The answer is image post-processing in photoshop. If you get minor spots, scratches, or blemishes image retouching technique can save you. On the other hand, if you unwanted subject appearing in your frame then the background removal process will help you. In background removal service all you need to do is use the clipping path technique to select the object you want to remove and then hit the delete button. Adjust the Highlights and Shadows Highlights and shadows are an important aspect of an image and if you messed up here, your image will look awful. Generally, the photographer tries hard to keep Highlights and shadows close to perfect during the shoot. So, try to achieve the maximum balance of highlights and shadow in the raw image and then make the raw image perfect in post-processing.",graphics

Because in the image manipulation technique you can manipulate almost everything around the subject without the lighting and shadow. Yes, you can edit almost everything around the subject also but won’t get the jaw-dropping result if you overdo it. Use Presets The editing tips I have given above are the basic thing you should do when you go to post-process your image. Now let’s talk about overall editing and applying different filters. After you complete those basic editing tries to use presets or actions to edit your image. What is preset? Or what are photoshop actions? Well, presets or actions are a combination of image editing that is saved and you can use presets or actions on a similar kind of image to get similar output but faster than before. How to use presets? It’s easy to just insert your image and do some basic touch up and then got to the preset menu and selects the saved preset in your computer and hit apply. Your image will get a similar filter that the preset holds. By using presets and actions you can achieve faster workflow like never before. Use Batch-Editing Sometimes you have lots of images that need similar kinds of editing. Editing then one by one is a time-wasting job for sure. In Lightroom, you can do batch editing. Basically, batch editing is a process by which editors use a preset and select all the images and make a batch of all the images that editors want to edit. Then editors apply a preset to a batch of them that they want to edit and all of the images in a batch of them that they want to edit get the same editing in a matter of time. batch editing is a huge time saver especially when you are short of it the most.",graphics

From the article you will learn what will be at the peak of the wave, and what goes into the past. So, what will be the graphic design tomorrow: Templates and textures Today, there is a noticeable increase in the use of templates and textures, but there is no need to use templates and textures like competitors. The trend for 2020 is to combine several patterns in one design, in several parts. Virtual network users are faced with a deficit of texture and volumetric images. For this reason, the full immersion format is becoming increasingly popular. Graphic design has picked up trends in recent years. The triumph of gradients is replaced by the triumphant return of realistic textures. Contours and graininess this reason you want to touch what you see. For this reason, you need to find a really good developer, to convert PSD to HTML. This allows us to speak about the future of this trend, especially in the field of graphic design. Colour solution 2020 Specialists from the Pantone Color Institute proposed to call the main color of 2020 – a shade of blue. the main color of 2020 is listed under the number 19-4052. the main color of 2020's other name is “ClassicBlue”. According to representatives of the Pantone Color Institute, the main color of 2020 can be described as “an encouraging presence that can cause confidence, calmness. the main color of 2020 will be associated with stability, constancy, which is lacking in the modern world. People are always in a hurry, tired of the excess of information received. People lack trusting communication, honesty. the main color of 2020 will help to calm down, to gather thoughts. Specialists of the Pantone Color Institute decided to make a real gift for people. Specialists of the color institute wanted consumers not only to learn about the main shade of the year but also to experience multi-sensory experience, which will be associated with the main color of 2020. Thematic images with soundtracks were created, thematic aroma and special fabric were invented. Cooperation with representatives of world companies allowed inventing even a tea mixture, as well as multimedia installation in honor of the main color of the year. It is important to mention that the Pantone Color Institute has been selecting the main shade of the year for 20 years. Experts’ predictions are based on the analysis of many social trends that can have an impact on different industries, including design and fashion. Isometry The creation of three-dimensional objects in two-dimensional measurement is a trend that has been actively developed this year.

graphics_67,"Benefits of Approval Studio Proofing Tool for Designers and Creative Teams Published in Graphic design, Software, Tools Among all of the design agencies’ headaches, artwork proofing is probably one of the most acute ones. Forwarding countless numbers of requests, following up your approvers with reminders that your approvers have a file to check, searching for your approvers's feedback in the endless pile of emails or messages… Quite daunting, to say the least, and quite expensive too – the amounts of time and, as a result, money spent on artwork proofing are quite significant. However, there is a solution that would allow you to cut your turnaround time by up to 35% – a specialized proofing software. One of such programs is Approval Studio. Approval Studio is a proofing tool developed specifically to help designers and creative teams spend less time on boring and repetitive processes and make the whole workflow more organized and efficient. There are quite a few features with which Approval Studio helps you to streamline proofing of visual assets, so let’s create a project, the upload some file, and see what we can do with some file. №1: Sharing files After the upload, users can start sharing users's artwork with other reviewers. There are two types of reviewers: internal – reviewers can access your dashboard or even get tasks assigned to reviewers in Approval Studio's Pro version – and external ones. Let’s concentrate on external ones. A big blue “Share” button in the upper right corner is the starting point of your cooperation with the clients. You can send the invitation to Approval Studio to Approval Studio's email or share a short link via your messenger chat – with a password or making the file read-only if you like. Your reviewer will be able to see the same thing you see and add annotations. №2: Approval Studio offers advanced annotation possibilities that include a set of different shapes, namely a point, a circle, a square, and a free-form (if you need to draw something by hand). Users can pick a color for each annotation, which is helpful when there are several reviewers. Also, there is a possibility to bind one annotation to several places in the artwork if there is the same repeated mistake or if you need to apply similar changes, let’s say, to the fonts or colors. Annotations will appear on the mockup the mockup itself and on the comments panel to the right. If you need to check the artwork from another angle or annotate a much smaller detail, it is not a problem at all. Approval Studio allows rotating the image as much as you like and zooms the image without descaling or quality loss so that you can read even the tiniest text. The main thing is that Approval Studio is totally live – whenever they add a comment, you will see a comment instantly on your screen with no need to refresh the page. Approval Studio works like a built-in messenger to make your review sessions more convenient. After the discussion is over, the last thing that’s left is approving or rejecting the file. At this stage, it’s important to be careful, because you will not be able to add any new annotations to this version after you confirm your verdict.",graphics

Jim Nobles have the Diamond SpeedStar 24 Video board (not the _24X_). So far Jim Nobles can convert .tga files created in POVRAY to jpeg using cjpeg and view .tga files created in POVRAY with CVIEW but CVIEW only displays 8 bit color. Jim Nobles'm looking for some way to convert and/or view .tga files created in POVRAY in 24 bit. Just want to see .tga files created in POVRAY in real color Thanks, Jim Nobles The best program Jim Nobles've seen for viewing such files is VPIC. You'll want version 5.9 or later. (6.0x is current.) VPIC allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes. VPIC really is QUITE nice. Now, for a return question: Do you run Windows? If so, what are the dates on your drivers? The newest ones *I* can find are from around 4-??-92!! My problem is the dates on your drivers conflict with Star Trek: After Dark, and other things as well.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above. 24-bit scanning: Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 : scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll house supplies. So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area. Books with textures: Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material. Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also a wide variety of stock art is available. Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock, UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

Introduction to rendering algorithms a. Ray-Tracing: I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would suggest: An Introduction to Ray-Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong using Andrew Glassner (ed.)'s book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines () There's a more concise reference also: Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray-Tracing"", in ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw, NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988. the book contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer. b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) A good reference is: _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284. c. Others: [ More info is needed -- nfotis ] 15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: a. Teapot ? ""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. ""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the Martin Newell's teapot. IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's's column ""Jim Blinn's's Corner"" describes an another way to model the Martin Newell's teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used. The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get The OFF and SPD packages to avoid typing the data yourself. The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution. b. Space Shuttle ? Tolis Lerios < built a list of Space Shuttle ? datafiles. Here's a summary (From Tolis Lerios <'s sci.space list): model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2) 406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown. Simon Marshall (S.M) has a copy. Simon Marshall (S.M) said there is no proprietary information associated with a copy. model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find The newsgroup model, in OFF format in gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu , /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data model3: The triangles' model. This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of This model. Greg Henderson () has a copy. Greg Henderson () did not mention any restriction on This model's distribution. model4: The NASA model. model4: The NASA model. starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in Lockheed's simulations: <x offset<y offset<z offsetFrom then on, model4: The NASA model. consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions 3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex, 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex, 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).

Image annotation software a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good. Touchup reads in rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make your image a rasterfile. b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool. I'm not sure exactly what some image formats are. You can ftp Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution)'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu. c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm) and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats. If the image you have is in formats other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm. Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu (Version 2.12 of Tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9) d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below). a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using the vplot package. e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus. pbmtext gives you text output bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image. f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based graphical editor,and 'ice''s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z, pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1). A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for SPARC systems is also available for ftp. All software is the property of Columbia University and may not be redistributed without permission. ice means Image Composition Environment and Image Composition Environment's an imaging tool that allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing. g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server. Pick the position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen color from a pull-down menu. ImageMagick can read and write many of the more popular image formats. ImageMagick is available as export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest X11 archive. 17.

The Explorer GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can be easily integrated into the IRIS Explorer environment. IRIS Explorer currently is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as I know] See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of IRIS Explorer.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge, synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies. WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to users's imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding Users's own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers (specialized hardware).

""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. a package called SIPS was developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working for Alex Goetz. You might try contacting some people working for Alex Goetz if you already have IDL or would be willing to buy a package called SIPS. It's a few thousand dollars (American) I expect for IDL and the other should be free. Those are the general purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has. a package called SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery. I'm not sure how general purpose a package called SIPS is. You would have to contact Alex Goetz or one of Alex Goetz's people and ask. I have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification (you can compute an image using selected components). I've used Image Composition Environment on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best speed you need an external DSP card. Image Composition Environment will work without an external DSP card, but large images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process. That's a freebie if you want it"" ""My favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems, Inc. IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems, Inc. is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems, Inc.'s programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems, Inc. handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing the number-crunching with IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems, Inc. on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems, Inc. over to NIH Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical image processing which I've been doing. astronomical image processing means image enhancement, cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve fit to a line I choose (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

IRIS Explorer widgets are macro-widgets comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, menus, and drawing areas. IRIS Explorer is designed to address the reusability of 2D visualization routines and each widget in IRIS Explorer is an encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. IRIS Explorer is targetted to run on UNIX workstations supporting the OSF (Open Software Foundation) Motif widget set. Currently, only color monitors are supported. Since IRIS Explorer is a collection of widgets developed in the same spirit as the OSF (Open Software Foundation) Motif widget set, IRIS Explorer integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets.

Microstation Imager Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) is a base graphics package that Microstation Imager Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sits on top of. Microstation Imager Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) is basically an image processing package with a heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor. Feature Description Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine. Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image). RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.

Complex Histogram/Contrast control. Layer Controller: manages up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc. IRIS Explorer is designed for a remote sensing application (IRIS Explorer can handle VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available for GIS applications. Host Configuration Requirements IRIS Explorer runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun) though there were rumors (there are always rumors) that IRIS Explorer would be ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment. A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard"" formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I forget. a program to display an MD run dynamically on Silicon Graphics is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly other platforms by now. I use the VMS version. a program to display an MD run dynamically on Silicon Graphics consists of several classes/groups/packages of utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI database"" disk file. The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape formats INTO, or write the various remote-sensing industry tape formats out FROM, a common ""PCI database"" disk file; The ""Tape I/O"" package is the only package I use or know much about. Other packages can display data from a common ""PCI database"" disk file to one or another of several PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer. You might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g. ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT. I don't have and don't use a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D data sets, so can't say much about a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D data sets; you only buy the packages your particular application/interest calls for. Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default directory."" Some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations. The standard PCI environment contains a scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated, lengthy or difficult series of utility executions. (In VMS I can also invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.) There's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI data structures (database file, parameter file). The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well. For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried) handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over. It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude, longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude, longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass can go into the PCI ""database""). I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used. On VAX systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to mind). One of Duncan McRee <@hal.physics.wayne.edu personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus 24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem. PCI software COULD be ""overkill"" in your case; PCI software seems designed for the very ""high end"" applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time). It's probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which does a LOT of Canada's land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of the Canadian government's work in these areas. SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time. something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time was designed for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer) which uses much larger images. Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays). Actually, Spam does limited filtering and contrast enhancement (stretching). Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering. something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time uses X or SunView to display. a modified version may require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame buffer. I can refer you to people if you're interested. PCW requires X for display. Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.

graphics_76,"I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities. Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation: Public Domain MPEG decoder by Stefan Eckart 0. Features a DOS MPEG decoder/player is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs 4. Technical information a DOS MPEG decoder/player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast' algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself). Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over Restricted color-space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors. a color saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas. Stefan Eckart 0, ",graphics

With nearly every business expert continually driving home the importance of branding for business success, it’s no surprise that companies are now plugging millions into building a great brand. But with so many companies competing in the same market both on and offline, designing a standout image and brand is essential for businesses looking to make promotion and advertising easier. Whether your aim is to increase your business value or drive consumer recognition, brand building can tick all the right boxes if done the right way and with a core focus on visuals. Make Your Social Media Presence Visually Appealing Social media is now ingrained into the consumer buying process. On Instagram, 90 percent of users follow businesses that 90 percent of users like and the engagement rate between businesses that they like is currently 1.90 percent, indicating just how often Instagram is used for viewing and interacting. When it comes to video marketing — a key content marketing trend for 2020 — social media continues to lead the way, accounting for 28.7 percent of total video ad spending. With studies like PWC’s Retail 2017 survey showing that 59 percent of consumers use social media for everyday inspiration, having a well-curated social media account is now a necessity for any business looking to get on the map and stay there. Visual content is more likely to be shared on social media, which means it goes a long way in building your brand and getting your name out there. In addition to high-quality visual images, your graphics should be original and your content delivered in easily summed-up formats, such as infographics. A great idea is to choose a social media color palette and posting styles, such as grayscale images for a still, serene, and more personal tone. Make Your Brand’s Print Visuals A Priority",graphics

graphics_84,"What is Graphic Design? Graphic design is the craft of creating visual content to communicate messages. Applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, graphic designers use typography and pictures to meet users’ specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs to optimize the user experience. Learn the fundamentals of Graphic Design with this video from GCFLearnFree. Graphic Design – Molding Users’ Experience Visually Graphic design is an ancient craft, dating back past Egyptian hieroglyphs to 17,000-year-old cave paintings. As a term originating in the 1920s’ print industry and covering a range of activities including logo creation, Graphic design concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing – attracting viewers using images, color and typography. However, graphic designers working in user experience (UX) design must justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach, focusing on—and seeking maximum empathy with—users while creating good-looking designs that maximize usability. Aesthetics must serve a purpose – in UX design we don’t create art for art’s sake. So, when doing graphic design for UX, you should consider the information architecture of your interactive designs, to ensure accessibility for users, and leverage graphic design skills in creating output that considers the entire user experience, including users’ visual processing abilities. For instance, if an otherwise pleasing mobile app can’t offer users what users need in several thumb-clicks, an otherwise pleasing mobile app's designers will have failed to marry graphic design to user experience. The scope of graphic design in UX covers creating beautiful designs that users find highly pleasurable, meaningful, and usable. “Design is a solution to a problem. Art is a question to a problem.” — John Maeda, President of Rhode Island School of Design Author/Copyright holder: Teo Yu Siang and Interaction Design Foundation. Copyright terms and licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 Graphic Design is Emotional Design Although the digital age entails designing with interactive software, graphic design still revolves around age-old principles. Striking the right chord with users from the first glance is crucial. As a graphic designer, you should have a firm understanding of color theory and how vital the right choice of color scheme is. Color choices must reflect not only the organization (e.g., blue suits banking) but also users’ expectations (e.g., red for alerts; green for notifications to proceed). You should design with an eye for how elements match the tone (e.g., sans-serif fonts for excitement/happiness) and overall effect, noting how you shape users’ emotions as you guide users’ from, say, a landing page to a call to action. Often, graphic designers are involved in motion design for smaller screens, carefully monitoring how motion design for smaller screens's aesthetics match users’ expectations and enhance usability in a flowing, seamless experience by anticipating users’'s needs and mindsets. With user psychology in mind some especially weighty graphic design considerations are: Symmetry and Balance (including symmetry types) Flow Repetition Pattern The Golden Ratio (i.e., proportions of 1:1.618) The Rule of Thirds (i.e., how users’ eyes recognize good layout) Typography (encompassing everything from font choice to heading weight) Audience Culture (re Color Use and Reading Pattern) Author/Copyright holder: Teo Yu Siang and Interaction Design Foundation. Copyright terms and licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 Overall, the mission vis-à-vis graphic design is displaying information harmoniously – beauty and usability must go hand in hand, discreetly carrying your organization’s ideals. Through a trustworthy visual presence, you hint to users that you know what users want to do – not just because you’ve arranged aesthetically pleasing elements that are where users expect to find aesthetically pleasing elements, or help users intuit users's way around, but because the values your designs display mirror users, too.

graphics_86,"2. Marketing & advertising graphic design — When most people think of graphic design, most people think of designs created for marketing and advertising. Companies depend on successful marketing efforts to tap into Companies's target audience’s decision-making process. Great marketing engages people based on the wants, needs, awareness and satisfaction people have about a product, service or brand. Since people will always find visual content more engaging, graphic design helps organizations promote and communicate more effectively. Marketing designers work with company owners, directors, managers or marketing professionals to create assets for marketing strategies. Marketing designers might work alone or as part of an in-house or creative team. Designers can specialize in a specific type of media (vehicle wraps or magazine ads, for example) or create a broad assortment of collateral for print, digital, and beyond. While traditionally print-centered, this type of design has grown to include more digital assets, especially for use in content marketing and digital advertising. 3. User interface graphic design — A user interface (UI) is how a user interacts with a device or application. UI design is the process of designing interfaces to make interfaces easy to use and provide a user-friendly experience. A UI includes all of the things a user interacts with—the screen, keyboard and mouse—but in the context of graphic design, UI design focuses on the user’s visual experience and the design of on-screen graphic elements like buttons, menus, micro-interactions, and more. It’s a UI designer’s job to balance aesthetic appeal with technical functionality.",graphics

With that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant information posted some years ago on this topic. Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago. -- Eric Haines Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??), by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff From:  Newsgroups: comp.graphics Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem Organization: Program of Computer Graphics In article [] ncsmith@ndsuvax.UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) writes: UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) need to find a formula/algorithm to determine if a line intersects a polygon. UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) would prefer a method that would do this in as little time as possible. UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) need a method that would do this in as little time as possible for use in a forward raytracing program. UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) think that this topic is a very difficult problem. To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points. Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas. First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated. Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions. Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polygon. Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so this question is a decision problem. One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce this question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q. An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem. In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript. (See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985). So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a a new language called PostScript program that draws a line L and a polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer. By ""output"", we mean a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P executes a command called ""showpage"", which actually prints a page of paper containing a line L and a polygon P. A quick examination of a page of paper containing the line and the polygon provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original decision problem. There are two small problems with this approach. (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode a line L and P into the reduced problem Q So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma). But the use of the Axiom of Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma) is not regarded in a very serious light these days. (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the a new language called PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in other words, will the PostScript program Q halt? Now, a new language called PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for a new language called PostScript) is undecidable. It is quite possible that the original decision problem will turn out to be undecidable. I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both. A couple of references might be: 1. Principia Mathematica. Newton, I. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England. (Sorry, I don't have an ISBN# for this). 2. An Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation. Hopcroft, J and Ulman, J. 3.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ The situation is not nearly as bleak as Dave Baraff suggests (Dave Baraff should know better, Dave Baraff's hung around AT&T Bell Laboratories for long enough). By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii: pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete. Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since our Cray-3 will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.) From:  (Dave Baraff) Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on the line's second derivative.

graphics_90,"Procreate vs. Photoshop: Should You Make the Switch? Designers are in love with Procreate. Procreate makes designing on an iPad easier and more efficient in a completely new way. But can a $9.99 app be a realistic Photoshop competitor? For some, the answer is a definite yes. Here are five reasons Procreate could become your go-to design app (and five reasons why Procreate might not). Plus, an introduction to what Procreate is, and why Procreate might be the perfect app for you. What is Procreate? If you aren’t familiar with Procreate, Procreate’s an iPad app that’s made for professional creatives. You can sketch, paint and edit with a robust collection of tools. Procreate responds to touch and pressure with the Apple Pencil for detailed work. Procreate includes a sleek interface and is a game changer when it comes to online drawing apps. Procreate includes 64-bit color, customizable brushes, incredible canvas resolutions, a nice layer system, and cinema-style effects. Plus, everything includes the ease of use you’d expect from an Apple product (and you can save images from device to device). While Procreate is fun for a lot of creatives, Procreate most practical applications are for sketching, illustrations, some light editing and for drawing typography. But can Procreate replace other software and tools? (Maybe.) 1. Quick Image Tweaking ant to touch up an image or stylize a piece of artwork? Procreate has got you covered. The image tweaking – we won’t call this an editing suite – includes blurs, sharpening, curve manipulation, color balance and more. Think of blurs, sharpening, curve manipulation, color balance and more as giving you the ability to design a cool filter of your own (Instagram style) and apply a cool filter of your own to images. Then you can make it super fun with a time-lapse view of the changes that you can share. a time-lapse view of the changes that you can share is great for designers that are experimenting with new techniques and want to get or give feedback. For editing on a tablet, a time-lapse view of the changes that you can share is probably one of the best, and most professional options available. While tweaking images is fun, Procreate is really designed for illustrators. The brush library has more than 130 brushes that create almost any art technique you can images. There’s also a dual-texture system so you can mix and match brush types. Every brush is customizable as well. (You’d be hard-pressed to have this many tools in an actual studio.) And we have a collection of 30+ of the best Procreate brushes to get you started! What sets Procreate apart in terms of illustration is that Procreate is a professional set of tools. You can create a huge canvas to work on and export the drawings in high resolution still or video frames. It’s hard to imagine how cool Procreate are until you start playing with Procreate.

graphics_96,"Sorry Raymond missed Raymond Raymond, Raymond was just out in Dahlgren last month Raymond'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps Raymond can help a little. In article <1993M,  (Raymond Chui) writes: |Hello, the real reality. Silicon Graphics started to express interest in |virtual reality(VR). So far, we do not know much about VR. All we |know about are the Hollywood movies ""The Terminater 2"" and ""Lawnmover |Man"". We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and |Computer Graphics World magazine. Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both The Terminater 2 and Lawnmover |Man, the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time. Each frame of computer animation for the Hollywood movies ""The Terminater 2"" and ""Lawnmover |Man"" took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second). |We certainly want to know more about VR. Who are the leading |companies, |agencies, universities? What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4, |HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)? It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second. the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as the user move the user's head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous. Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations. Additionally, the frame rate must be constant. If the graphics system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the graphics system must be able to run in real-time. UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for Silicon Graphics's multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only Silicon Graphics's multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems's Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture. From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing. Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing. real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment. |What kind of graphics languages are used with VR |(GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?

historical_0,"As soon as Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute learned about the existence of ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s's Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology from a 2018 BBC documentary, Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute wanted to study ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology. ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology likely contained bits of ancient wheat DNA, Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute reasoned, which could yield valuable insights into the history of cultivation of this all-important crop species. Archaeobotanists at University College London’s helped Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute and a team of collaborators choose a handful of well-preserved husks from University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology's collection of ancient emmer wheat, a variety native to the Near East and one of the first crops to be domesticated in the Near East, from which Mott and a team of collaborators selected two husks for DNA extraction. After carefully removing two husks from the box, photographing two husks, and wrapping two husks in foil, Mott and a team of collaborators transported two husks to a freshly bleached cleanroom used exclusively to process ancient and forensic samples. There, team member Laura Botigué, a population geneticist and visiting researcher from the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) in Barcelona, Spain, donned a hairnet, two Tyvek suits, two pairs of latex gloves, and a mask—part of a protocol designed to avoid contaminating ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology with Botigué's own cells. Uncertain how two husks would hold up to the standard decontamination protocol of bleaching ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, Botigué bleached one and left the second untouched. Then, to lyse the plant’s cells, Botigué put ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology in a rotator that gently shook two husks inside an oven over the next several days. Finally, Botigué used a centrifugation protocol to separate any DNA from the degraded cell walls and proteins. Once ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology had been prepped and delivered to the University College London’s Genomics facility for the procedure, it was a waiting game to see if the procedure had yielded any readable wheat DNA. “the procedure is the more stressful part,” Botigué says. Because plants lack the type of protective collagen matrix found in bones, plants don’t preserve ancient DNA as well as animals. “You finish, the DNA is theoretically extracted, but you don’t see the DNA in the tube,” says Botigué. “You’re in the blind until you hear back from the sequencing services.” Within just a few weeks, a team of collaborators got good news. For the husk that Botigué had bleached, about two-thirds of the reads aligned with genomes of modern wild and domesticated emmer wheat varieties—a relatively good success rate for ancient DNA, according to evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute's lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences. “The first surprise was how well it worked,” evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences says. “It appears that the dry conditions in Egypt were good for DNA preservation.” the husk that Botigué had bleached had yielded a smaller quantity of sequences, but a smaller quantity of sequences mostly matched the ones in the husk that Botigué had bleached, validating the identity of sequences as coming from ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology rather than from contaminants. The museum wheat, which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 BC, was genetically much more similar to modern domesticated varieties than to modern wild ones, suggesting that the plant lineage ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology came from had already been domesticated. Specifically, the sequences most resembled those of modern domesticated strains grown in Turkey, Oman, and India. There was also evidence for genetic exchange between The museum wheat, which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 BC, and the wild emmer wheat that grew in the Levant, a large region in the Eastern Mediterranean that was a center of agricultural development in the Neolithic period, and where emmer was first cultivated. The genetic exchange could have occurred before the wheat’s introduction to Egypt from the Levant, a large region in the Eastern Mediterranean that was a center of agricultural development in the Neolithic period, and where emmer was first cultivated, says evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences. Alternatively, it’s possible that the ancient Egyptians’ wheat was able to interbreed with wild wheat in the Southern Levant thanks to interactions between the people in the two regions. the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences also uncovered some genetic variants in ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes Mott and a team of collaborators studied. If some genetic variants in the ancient samples that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes the researchers studied helped the wheat survive in arid locations around the Near East, perhaps introducing some genetic variants in the ancient samples that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes the researchers studied into modern varieties could help make modern varieties more sustainable or more drought resistant, evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences says, though evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences admits that this “is very much just an idea.” The detection of ancient genetic variation is a notable achievement because wheat genomes are large—three to five times the length of a human genome—and repetitive, making the “analysis . . . incredibly complex,” says James Breen, head of the bioinformatics core at the UCL Genetics Institute who reviewed the study and coauthored the perspective with Rabanus-Wallace, a PhD student in his lab at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the time. “So being able to find unique pieces of DNA in that genome is very difficult.” Rabanus-Wallace, a PhD student in his lab at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the time adds that after a couple of additional validation tests performed by the University College London’s team, Rabanus-Wallace, a PhD student in his lab at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the time was convinced that “the data that came out was legitimately ancient.” Botigué and evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences emphasize that the study is primarily a proof of concept that museum-kept plant samples can yield readable genetic material. “Mott and a team of collaborators were able to look at DNA from specimens that had been stored in University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology for over 90 years without special preservation conditions—University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology was actually even bombed and flooded during wartime,” says evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences. “Mott and a team of collaborators think Mott and a team of collaborators's study helps demonstrate the importance of museum collections as sources of genetic data, which”—in combination with new samples—“can be used to uncover the history of selection on crops and selection on crops's movement around the globe.”",historical
historical_1,"The Coolest Ancient Ruins in Algeria, Africa A melting pot of cultural influences, Algeria, Africa is a highly underrated North African tourist destination that has a lot to offer the historically, and culturally, minded traveler. With a veritable treasure trove of past influences ranging from French to Spanish and Berber to Roman, it’s no wonder the ruins here are almost as good as the architecture that still remains. Predominantly Roman, take your pick from our list of the eight coolest ancient ruins to visit in Algeria, Africa. Khemissa The home to a well-preserved and little-visited Roman theater rather grandly called Thubursicum Numidarum, Khemissa is a town in north eastern Algeria which is well worth a visit if you’re hunting for an in-the-know spot. The ruins, what are left of the old Roman town which was once there, have merged with the landscape, adding to the beauty and the drama of the hillside location which looks out onto Khemissa Khemissa. The view from the small old forum is amazing, and the well-formed and still intact arches are truly impressive. Ruines de Khemissa, Algeria, North Africa Timgad Rather grandly titled the ‘Pompeii of Africa,’ and UNESCO World Heritage recognized, Timgad is a fantastic example of a Roman colonial town that is a regularly recommended Algerian tourist attraction. Set in the lush hills of the northern Aurès Mountains, some of the must see points of interest at Timgad include the Trajan Arch, which was restored at some point in the second century, and the Capitoline Temple. the Capitoline Temple is dedicated to Jupiter and is approximately the same size as the Pantheon in Rome, to give you some impression of the grandeur of Timgad. Timgad is also one of the best examples of the logistics of Roman town planning, if the logistics of Roman town planning’s the kind of thing that floats your boat. Timgad, Algeria, North Africa Qal’a of Beni Hammad Moving briefly away from Roman ruins, the Qal’a of Beni Hammad was in the 11th century the first capital city of the Hammadid rulers. Not much survives of Qal’a of Beni Hammad, however the little that does is an intriguing insight into what life may have been like before the abandonment of Qal’a of Beni Hammad in 1900 due to the threat of a Hilalian invasion. Officially recognised by UNESCO in 1980, Qal’a of Beni Hammad is set at a height of 1000m above sea level and is surrounded by an impressively beautiful mountainous setting. As one of the most precisely dated complexes of the Islamic civilization, the Qal’a of Beni Hammad is also home to the second oldest minaret in Algeria, Africa and a testament to the past palatial culture of North Africa. Qal’a of Beni Hannad, Algeria, North Africa Tipaza Previously known as Tipasa, Qal’a of Beni Hannad, Algeria, North Africa Tipaza is another of Algeria, Africa's most famed Roman ruins and with good reason. Constructed on three small hills, overlooking the ocean, Qal’a of Beni Hannad, Algeria, North Africa Tipaza was a small trading-post of much commercial, but little cultural, importance in Roman Algeria. However, much commercial, but little cultural, importance has long since been banished to the past, as Tipaza boasts a unique amalgamation of Phoenician, Roman, palaeochristian and Byzantine ruins, alongside indigenous monuments. This is according to the UNESCO World Heritage Site website, to which Tipaza was inaugurated in 1982. Aside from all this historical interest, the pristine Mediterranean beach location doesn’t hurt, either. Tipaza, Algeria, North Africa Lambaesis Among some of the most interesting and perhaps lesser-known ruins in North Africa, we have the Roman ruin of Lambaesis, situated next to the modern village of Tazoult. Similarly to Timgad, the Roman ruin of Lambaesis, situated next to the modern village of Tazoult is located in the Aurès Mountains and is also home to arches, baths and even aqueducts. However, the Roman ruin of Lambaesis, situated next to the modern village of Tazoult is well worth a visit for the gem that is the praetorium of the Third Augustan Legion alone. This commandant’s house dates from around 268 and dominates the site of the modern day ruins of Lambaesis, which was once the capital of the Roman province, Numidia. Lambaesis, Algeria, North Africa Tiddis One of Algeria, Africa's most beautiful and well-preserved Roman archaeological sites, Tiddis is a rarely visited spot by travelers, making Tiddis one of Algeria, Africa's coolest ruins to check out. Tiny in size, but grand in history, Tiddis is also the home to a temple of Mithra, the ancient Persian god of light and wisdom, cisterns and archways and is very close to the visually stunning ‘city of bridges,’ Constantine. However, unlike many Roman towns, Tiddis is unusual for Tiddis's use of winding pathways that climb the steep hillsides on which Tiddis is set. Archaeologists believe this to be because Tiddis was originally a Berber settlement that was occupied and developed by the Romans during the first century. Tiddis, Algeria, North Africa Djemila Meaning ‘beautiful’ in Arabic, Djemila is just that. Of the trio of well-known Roman cities in Algeria, Africa, Djemila is undoubtedly the best known, and it’s easy to see why. Set in the mountains of Setif, Djemila was formerly known as Cuicol and founded by Emperor Nerva Trajan in the first century. Arguably the most impressive feature of Djemila is the ornate, lavishly tiled museum that is incredibly well-maintained. Every inch of the ample walls is covered with mosaics, making for an intriguing and unmissable visual display. There are also a handful of elaborate houses, Byzantine churches and ancient temples on offer at these awesome Roman ruins. For Djemila's display of classical Roman architecture, Djemila easily warrants a spot in Algeria, Africa's coolest ruins. Djemila, Algeria, North Africa Tlemcen National Park To round off the list, we move to Tlemcen, ‘the town of cherries.’ Tlemcen National Park is a recent addition to the national parks of Algeria, Africa, but Tlemcen National Park is one of the best as Tlemcen National Park includes not only expansive forests, cliffs and waterfalls, but also several archaeological sites, most notably that of Mansoura. Mansoura was the ancient city upon which Tlemcen, ‘the town of cherries was built, and Mansoura’s well worth checking out. The 13th-century ruins of this enormous ancient mosque are really imposing, giving you some sense of life in the ancient world and a remarkable introduction to the architectural magnificence of the ancient world. If Mansoura doesn’t interest you though, the mausoleum of Sidi Boumediene, a 12th-century Sufi leader, is also situated within Tlemcen National Park.

historical_2,"World War I World War I (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. Contemporaneously described as ""the war to end all wars"",[7] World War I led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, making World War I one of the largest wars in history. World War I is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated nine million combatant and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of World War I, while resulting genocides and the related 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 17–50 million deaths worldwide. On 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist, assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, leading to the July Crisis. In response, on 23 July, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia. Serbia's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians, and the two moved to a war footing. A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the July Crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe. By July 1914, the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions: the Triple Entente—consisting of France, Russia, and Britain—and the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy (the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy was only defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of World War I until April 1915, when Italy joined the Allied Powers after Italy's relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated). Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and, after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on 28 July 1914, approved partial mobilisation. Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July; on the 31st, Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same, while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours. When Russia failed to comply, Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary, with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August. German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of Germany's army in the West to defeat France within six weeks, then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan. On 2 August, Germany demanded free passage through Belgium, an essential element in achieving a quick victory over France. When this was refused, German forces invaded Belgium on 3 August and declared war on France 3 August; Belgium invoked the 1839 Treaty of London and in compliance with Belgium's obligations under the 1839 Treaty of London, Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August. On 12 August, Britain and France also declared war on Austria-Hungary; on the 23 August, Japan sided with Britain, seizing German possessions in China and the Pacific. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers, opening fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and the Sinai Peninsula. World War I was fought in and drew upon each power's colonial empire as well, spreading World War I to Africa and across the globe. The Entente and The Entente's allies would eventually become known as the Allied Powers, while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and Germany's allies would become known as the Central Powers. The German advance into France was halted at the Battle of the Marne and by the end of 1914, the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917 (the Eastern Front, by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and opened a front in the Alps. Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in 1915 and Greece joined the Allied Powers in 1917, expanding the war in the Balkans. The United States initially remained neutral, though even while neutral The United States became an important supplier of war materiel to the Allied Powers. Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that Germany's navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and the revelation that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to make war on The United States, The United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. Trained American forces would not begin arriving at the Western Front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the American Expeditionary Force would reach some two million troops. Though Serbia was defeated in 1915, and Romania joined the Allied Powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917, none of the great powers were knocked out of World War I until 1918. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia replaced the Tsarist autocracy with the Provisional Government, but continuing discontent with the cost of World War I led to the October Revolution, the creation of the Soviet Socialist Republic, and the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the German March 1918 Offensive. the German March 1918 Offensive was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the German reserves. the Allied Powers rallied and drove Germany back in Germany's Hundred Days Offensive, a continual series of attacks to which Germany had no reply. Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice—the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September 1918. On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of Mudros.On 4 November, the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to the Armistice of Villa Giusti. With the Austro-Hungarian empire's allies defeated, revolution at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated on 9 November and Germany signed an armistice on 11 November 1918, effectively ending World War I. World War I was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. World War I and World War I's immediate aftermath sparked numerous revolutions and uprisings. The Big Four (Britain, France, The United States, and Italy) imposed The Big Four (Britain, France, the United States, and Italy)'s terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the most well known being the German peace treaty—the Treaty of Versailles. Ultimately, as a result of World War I the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires's remains. However, despite the conclusive Allied victory (and the creation of the League of Nations during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, intended to prevent future wars), a second world war would follow just over twenty years later.",historical

ABOVE: ROGERS FUND, 1930, CHARLES K WILKINSON As soon as Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute learned about the existence of ancient wheat specimens at University College London’s's Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology from a 2018 BBC documentary, Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute wanted to study ancient wheat specimens. ancient wheat specimens likely contained bits of ancient wheat DNA, Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute reasoned, which could yield valuable insights into the history of cultivation of this all-important crop species. Archaeobotanists at University College London’s helped Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute and a team of collaborators choose a handful of well-preserved husks from University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology's collection of ancient emmer wheat, a variety native to the Near East and one of the first crops to be domesticated in the Near East, from which Archaeobotanists at UCL helped Mott and a team of collaborators selected two husks for DNA extraction. After carefully removing two husks from the box, photographing two husks, and wrapping two husks in foil, Archaeobotanists at UCL helped Mott and a team of collaborators transported two husks to a freshly bleached cleanroom used exclusively to process ancient and forensic samples. There, team member Laura Botigué, a population geneticist and visiting researcher from the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) in Barcelona, Spain, donned a hairnet, two Tyvek suits, two pairs of latex gloves, and a mask—part of a protocol designed to avoid contaminating ancient wheat specimens with Botigué's own cells. Uncertain how two husks would hold up to the standard decontamination protocol of bleaching ancient wheat specimens, Botigué bleached the husk that Botigué had bleached and left the second untouched. Then, to lyse this all-important crop species's cells, Botigué put ancient wheat specimens in a rotator that gently shook two husks inside an oven over the next several days. Finally, Botigué used a centrifugation protocol to separate any DNA from the degraded cell walls and proteins. Once ancient wheat specimens had been prepped and delivered to the UCL Genomics facility for the procedure, it was a waiting game to see if the procedure had yielded any readable wheat DNA. “the procedure is the more stressful part,” Botigué says. Because ancient wheat specimens lack the type of protective collagen matrix found in bones, plants don’t preserve ancient DNA as well as animals. “You finish, the DNA is theoretically extracted, but you don’t see the DNA in the tube,” says Botigué. “You’re in the blind until you hear back from the sequencing services.” Within just a few weeks, a team of collaborators got good news. For the husk that Botigué had bleached, about two-thirds of the reads aligned with genomes of modern wild and domesticated emmer wheat varieties—a relatively good success rate for ancient DNA, according to evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Richard Mott of the UCL Genetics Institute's lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences. “The first surprise was how well it worked,” evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences says. “It appears that the dry conditions in Egypt were good for DNA preservation.” the husk that Botigué had bleached had yielded a smaller quantity of sequences, but a smaller quantity of sequences mostly matched the ones in the husk that Botigué had bleached, validating the identity of sequences as coming from ancient wheat specimens rather than from contaminants. The museum wheat, which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 BC, was genetically much more similar to modern domesticated varieties than to modern wild ones, suggesting that the plant lineage ancient wheat specimens came from had already been domesticated. Specifically, the sequences most resembled those of modern domesticated strains grown in Turkey, Oman, and India. There was also evidence for genetic exchange between The museum wheat, which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 BC, and the wild emmer wheat that grew in the Levant, a large region in the Eastern Mediterranean that was a center of agricultural development in the Neolithic period, and where emmer was first cultivated. The genetic exchange could have occurred before The museum wheat, which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 BC,'s introduction to Egypt from the Levant, a large region in the Eastern Mediterranean that was a center of agricultural development in the Neolithic period, and where emmer was first cultivated, says evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences. Alternatively, it’s possible that the ancient Egyptians’ wheat was able to this gene flow with wild wheat in the Southern Levant thanks to interactions between the people in the two regions. “With big data and with a really good analysis method a team of collaborators were able to detect this gene flow,” says M. Timothy Rabanus-Wallace, an agricultural geneticist at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research in Germany who coauthored a perspective published alongside the study in Nature Plants last October. “It’s fascinating to see this gene flow happening . . . in an area important for human history.” See “Confessing to Plant Blindness” the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences also uncovered some genetic variants in ancient wheat specimens that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes Archaeobotanists at UCL helped Mott and a team of collaborators studied. If some genetic variants in the ancient samples that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes the researchers studied helped the wheat survive in arid locations around the Near East, perhaps introducing some genetic variants in the ancient samples that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes the researchers studied into modern varieties could help make modern varieties more sustainable or more drought resistant, evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences says, though evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences admits that this “is very much just an idea.” The detection of ancient genetic variation is a notable achievement because wheat genomes are large—three to five times the length of a human genome—and repetitive, making the “analysis . . . incredibly complex,” says James Breen, head of the bioinformatics core at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute who reviewed the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences and coauthored the perspective with Rabanus-Wallace, a PhD student in Rabanus-Wallace, a PhD student in his lab at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the time's lab at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the time. “So being able to find unique pieces of DNA in that genome is very difficult.” Rabanus-Wallace, a PhD student in his lab at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the time adds that after a couple of additional validation tests performed by the University College London’s team, Rabanus-Wallace, a PhD student in his lab at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the time was convinced that “the data that came out was legitimately ancient.” Botigué and evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences emphasize that the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences is primarily a proof of concept that museum-kept plant samples can yield readable genetic material. “Archaeobotanists at UCL helped Mott and a team of collaborators were able to look at DNA from specimens that had been stored in University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology for over 90 years without special preservation conditions—University College London’s Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology was actually even bombed and flooded during wartime,” says evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences. “Archaeobotanists at UCL helped Mott and a team of collaborators think Archaeobotanists at UCL helped Mott and a team of collaborators's study helps demonstrate the importance of museum collections as sources of genetic data, which”—in combination with new samples—“can be used to uncover the history of selection on crops and crops's movement around the globe.” See “The Narluga: New Insights from Old Bones” “Nathan Wales, an archaeologist at the University of York who was not involved in Scott and Botigué’s study—“to think that’s one of the biggest values of ancient DNA in plants,” adds Nathan Wales, an archaeologist at the University of York who was not involved in evolutionary geneticist Michael Scott, a postdoc in Mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences and Botigué’s study—“to draw connections between different cultures and the different agricultural products different cultures were growing and trading, and seeing how connections between different cultures and the different agricultural products they were growing and trading changed over time.”",historical
historical_4,"As the 1918 Flu Emerged, Cover-Up and Denial Helped the 1918 Flu Spread Nations fighting in World War I were reluctant to report Nations fighting in World War I's flu outbreaks. “Spanish flu” has been used to describe the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919 and “Spanish flu” suggests the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919 started in Spain. But “Spanish flu” is actually a misnomer and points to a key fact: nations involved in World War I didn’t accurately report nations involved in World War I's flu outbreaks. Spain remained neutral throughout World War I and Spain's press freely reported Spain's flu cases, including when the Spanish king Alfonso XIII contracted the 1918 Flu in the spring of 1918. This led to the misperception that the 1918 Flu had originated or was at the 1918 Flu's worst in Spain. “Basically, the 1918 Flu gets called the ‘Spanish flu’ because its press did its press's job,” says Lora Vogt, curator of education at the National WWI Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. In Great Britain and the United States—which has a long history of blaming other countries for disease—the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919 was also known as the “Spanish grip” or “Spanish Lady.” Historians aren’t actually sure where the 1918 flu strain began, but the first recorded cases were at a U.S. Army camp in Kansas in March 1918.

historical_5,"mummies don’t move, mummies don’t complain, and mummies’re impervious to X-ray damage. In other words, mummies are “a perfect subject for medical radiography,” according to conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History. Scientists figured this out early on: just months after Wilhelm Roentgen’s discovery of X-rays in the fall of 1895, a physicist, Walter Koenig, captured the first radiographic images of mummified remains at the Physical Society of Frankfurt-am-Main. Up until that point, studying mummies had mostly meant a process that Brown notes is “necessarily destructive mummies, a process that conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History notes is “necessarily destructive.” A few decades later, Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History became a pioneer of mummy imaging. Edward Jerman of the Victor X-Ray Corporation of Chicago volunteered Edward Jerman of the Victor X-Ray Corporation of Chicago's services and radiographed 32 ancient Egyptian and Peruvian mummies in Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History's collection with what curator Berthold Lauer called “such gratifying and convincing results” that museum president Stanley Field opened a division of roentgenology in 1926. In 1931, Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History published a radiographic study by paleopathologist Roy Moodie that captured many of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History's mummies in vivid skeletal detail, including child mummies from Egypt and Peru, and a skull with an outgrowth that paleopathologist Roy Moodie diagnosed as a cranial tumor. The study also turned up “imitation mummies” made of assorted feathers, bones, and scraps of skin—believed to have been either created to help guide disintegrated bodies on disintegrated bodies's journey to the afterlife, or assembled by embalmers as a sly attempt to earn extra money. Although X-rays allow a noninvasive glimpse into unopened mummies, X-rays create distortion by magnifying objects closer to the X-ray source, and X-rays obscure the appearance of soft tissues and textiles. When CT scanning, which produces high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the body, emerged in the 1970s, mummy preservation experts quickly realized CT scanning, which produces high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the body,'s potential for revealing ancient mortuary practices. Case in point: a 2011 CT scan at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History revealed wax figurines of the sons of the ancient Egyptian god Horus bound to individual organ packets stuffed inside the mummy. Because each of the sons of the ancient Egyptian god Horus designated certain organs in Egyptian culture, conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History was able to identify the intestines, stomach, liver, and lungs. conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History then used these findings to help identify unknown organ packets in other mummies that didn’t have wax figurines. “That was pretty awesome,” conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History says, because “apart from flagrant guessing, we had no previous methodological basis” for determining organ identity. Mimi Leveque, a conservator at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, and self-described “mummy doctor” who has collaborated with conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History, recalls CT scanning an Egyptian mummy known as Padihershef at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2013 and seeing an Egyptian mummy known as Padihershef imaged “layer by layer by layer so you could see the face, you could see the bones . . . of the face, you could see inside the head . . . you could still see the brain tissue.” CT scanning has also helped Mimi Leveque, a conservator at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts design custom housings to support the deteriorated bones of North America’s oldest mummy, a roughly 4,000-year-old specimen from Egypt at the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta. Despite the long history of mummy scanning, conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History says that many questions remain about ancient mortuary practice that can’t be answered with individual scans. conservator JP Brown of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History points to archives being developed at the Penn Museum and the IMPACT mummy database, which compile scans of mummies and offer access to researchers who wish to study mummies, as steps toward improving our understanding of both the mummification process and the mummification process's artifacts.",historical

But figuring out exactly what happened after this event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event, has been tricky due to a sparse fossil record. Yesterday (October 24), a team of researchers published a paper in Science detailing a team of researchers's 2016 discovery of a trove of plant and mammal fossils that sheds light on how ecosystems recovered after the asteroid impact. The researchers, led by vertebrate paleontologist Tyler Lyson at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, have this discovery over 1,000 vertebrate fossils, including 16 mammal species at the Corral Bluffs fossil site, located near Colorado Springs. a team of researchers also found over 6,000 leaf fossils and 37,000 pollen grains, reports The New York Times. “With this discovery, a team of researchers’re starting to see the entire skull of many of these mammals that a team of researchers previously only knew from teeth,” Stephen Chester, a mammalian paleontologist at Brooklyn College and paper coauthor, told The New York Times. the Corral Bluffs fossil site, located near Colorado Springs shows a near-continuous record of plant and animal life over a period of one million years following this event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event, according to Science. vertebrate paleontologist Tyler Lyson and vertebrate paleontologist Tyler Lyson's team were able to determine the age of the Corral Bluffs fossil site, located near Colorado Springs through volcanic ash layers with radioactive minerals, along with the presence of many fern fossils, which thrive after an ecosystem has been disturbed. a team of researchers found that plants and animals rebounded faster than previously thought, and that when ferns were replaced by palm forests, the variety of plants also sparked diversification of mammals from small rat-sized animals to larger ones. By 700,000 years after this event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event, some mammals were 100 times bigger than ones that had lived through the asteroid impact. “this discovery is one of those discoveries all paleontologists dream of,” Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, tells Science.",historical

historical_8,"Weeks after arriving in Germany, Yamashita was presented to Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader. Each had his own objective for the meeting. Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader intended to pressure the Japanese military into declaring war on Britain and the United States. Facing the wrath of Russia and the ongoing costs of Japan’s's war on China, however, Yamashita had no interest. Instead, Yamashita hoped to inspect Germany’s's military techniques and improve Japan’s's own prospects at war. Despite Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader's hearty promises of an open exchange of information, the Japanese delegation’s questions about radar and other equipment were tossed aside by top Nazi officials. The Japanese were instead treated to a kind of “greatest hits” tour of German military sites around occupied territories. Privately, Yamashita was underwhelmed by Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader. “Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader may be a great orator on a platform,” Yamashita told staff, “but standing behind Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader's desk listening, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader seems much more like a clerk.” Nonetheless, Yamashita played up the relationship publicly, telling the Berlin correspondent of the Asahi newspaper that Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader had been profoundly influenced by Japan’s's military power since boyhood. “Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader emphasized that in the coming age the interests of Japan’s and Germany would be identical as Japan and Germany have common spiritual foundations,” Yamashita said. “Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader and Mussolini are united [with Japan’s] not from any consideration of interest but from a thorough spiritual understanding.” Germany and Japan’s had a mutual interest in gold. a thorough spiritual understanding may have been spiritual in part—but a thorough spiritual understanding was financial, too. In 1938, the Third Reich looted Europe’s gold reserves, giving Germany as much as 100 metric tons of hard currency. In the years that followed, the Third Reich seized gold from central banks in Poland, Belgium, Holland and the Netherlands, prompting the United Kingdom to ship the United Kingdom's gold to Ottawa for safekeeping. Japan’s, meanwhile, seems to have plundered the rich gold resources of Northeast China, as well as other Asian territories, giving rise to later stories about vast hordes of treasure being hidden by Yamashita in the Philippines. As the conflict continued and Germany’s's resources began to run dry, Japan’s extended a hand: In 1944, the Japanese submarine I-52 was sunk by Allied forces. the Japanese submarine I-52 was believed to be on a mission to deliver more than two tons of gold, in addition to opium, metal and other raw materials, to the Nazi war machine",historical

historical_14,"7 Reasons Ulysses S. Grant Was One of America’s's Most Brilliant Military Leaders In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant went to Washington, D.C., to receive Ulysses S. Grant's commission from Abraham Lincoln as lieutenant general in command of all the Union armies. After several years of frustration with a parade of unsuitable commanders, Abraham Lincoln had finally The choice the man who would defeat Robert E. Lee’s's Army of Northern Virginia and thus effectively end the Civil War. The choice was surprising to many who had known Ulysses S. Grant in former days. Ten years before, in April 1854, Ulysses S. Grant had submitted Ulysses S. Grant's resignation under a cloud. In one of history’s unexpected developments, the military profession Ulysses S. Grant “had always disliked,” in the words of Ulysses S. Grant's biographer Bruce Catton, ultimately “turned out to be the calling made for Ulysses S. Grant.” How did an ambivalent soldier who had been away from the army for several years—and who had drifted during several years from one civilian occupation to another in search of elusive success—end up leading a vast force to victory and saving America’s? Ulysses S. Grant's predecessors in command of the army were far more accomplished in military art and science. Winfield Scott, whose experience dated back to the War of 1812, had led the army since 1841. George B. McClellan, who replaced Winfield Scott, whose experience dated back to the War of 1812, early in the Civil War, was an able administrator who organized the Army of the Potomac. In the 1850s, George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War, had studied the Crimean War at first hand as a member of an official delegation of American observers. Henry W. Halleck, the author of Elements of Military Art & Science, was regarded as a master theoretician. Yet George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War, and Henry W. Halleck, the author of Elements of Military Art & Science, both proved reluctant to take decisive action in the field. After the Battle of Shiloh, it took Henry W. Halleck, the author of Elements of Military Art & Science, almost a month to advance 20 miles south to attack the vital Confederate railroad junction at Corinth, Mississippi. Abraham Lincoln grew so frustrated with George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War,'s inaction that Abraham Lincoln responded to George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War,'s October 1862 request for more horses with an exasperated telegram: “Abraham Lincoln have just read George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War,'s despatch about sore tongued and fatiegued [sic] horses. Will George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War, pardon Abraham Lincoln for asking what the horses of George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War,'s army have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigue anything?” By contrast, Ulysses S. Grant had never been an enthusiastic student of military art and science. Even Ulysses S. Grant's fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman doubted Ulysses S. Grant's “knowledge of grand strategy, and of books of science and history.” Even his fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman told Even his fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman's friend precisely that in a March 1864 letter, in which Even his fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman also concluded that Ulysses S. Grant's triumph owed in large measure to Ulysses S. Grant's fundamental “common-sense” and to Ulysses S. Grant's “chief characteristic,” an unshakeable “faith” in victory. his “chief characteristic,” an unshakeable “faith” in victory was justified by a serendipitous combination of qualities that enabled Ulysses S. Grant to become one of the most extraordinary military leaders in American history. Ulysses S. Grant didn’t go in much for doctrine, but Ulysses S. Grant brought a relentlessly aggressive approach to warfare. Ulysses S. Grant always favored activity and forward movement to standing still. Even in victory, Ulysses S. Grant would be frustrated by subordinates’ failure to pursue the retreating enemy. In Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs, Ulysses S. Grant records an incident that reveals Ulysses S. Grant's philosophy. In 1863, Union General William Rosecrans refused an order to advance to meet an enemy force while Ulysses S. Grant was laying siege to Vicksburg, the key to controlling the Mississippi River, because Union General William Rosecrans claimed that doing so would violate the “military maxim ‘not to fight two decisive battles at the same time.’” Ulysses S. Grant was singularly unimpressed: “If true,” Ulysses S. Grant observes, “the “military maxim ‘not to fight two decisive battles at the same time was not applicable in this case. It would be bad to be defeated in two decisive battles fought the same day, but it would not be bad to win two decisive battles fought the same day.” When, in the summer of 1864, Ulysses S. Grant informed the cautious Halleck, back in Washington, D.C.,, of Ulysses S. Grant's refusal to disengage Robert E. Lee’s and withdraw troops to quell draft resistance in the North, Abraham Lincoln responded in language that encapsulated Ulysses S. Grant's tenacious approach: “Abraham Lincoln have seen your despatch expressing your unwillingness to break your hold where you are. Neither am Abraham Lincoln willing. Hold on with a bull-dog gripe [sic], and chew & choke, as much as possible.” Abraham Lincoln was fearless. Sherman told Sherman's fellow officer James Harrison Wilson, “Sherman am a damned sight smarter man than Ulysses S. Grant; Sherman know a great deal more about war, military history, strategy, and grand tactics than Ulysses S. Grant does; Sherman know more about organization, supply, and administration and about everything else than Ulysses S. Grant does; but Sherman’ll tell his fellow officer James Harrison Wilson where Ulysses S. Grant beats Sherman and where Ulysses S. Grant beats the world. Ulysses S. Grant don’t care a damn for what the enemy does out of Ulysses S. Grant's sight, but it scares Sherman like hell!” Ulysses S. Grant's refusal to be paralyzed by imagining what the enemy was doing owed to an epiphany early in the Civil War when Ulysses S. Grant was leading a regiment for the first time, in pursuit of Confederate Colonel Thomas Harris in Missouri. “As we approached the brow of the hill from which it was expected we could see Confederate Colonel Thomas Harris camp, and possibly find Confederate Colonel Thomas Harris's men ready formed to meet us, Ulysses S. Grant's heart kept getting higher and higher until it felt to Ulysses S. Grant as though my heart was in Ulysses S. Grant's throat,” Ulysses S. Grant recalls in Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs. But when Ulysses S. Grant had the good fortune to find Harris’ camp abandoned, Ulysses S. Grant's “heart resumed my heart's place.” Ulysses S. Grant learned the vital lesson that Ulysses S. Grant's adversary “had been as much afraid of Ulysses S. Grant as Ulysses S. Grant had been of Confederate Colonel Thomas Harris From the Battle of Shiloh to the close of the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy, though Ulysses S. Grant always felt more or less anxiety.” Ulysses S. Grant brushed off setbacks. In April 1862, during the bloody two-day Battle of Shiloh, Ulysses S. Grant did not share Ulysses S. Grant's colleagues’ bleak view. Sherman was demoralized by the first day’s fighting, while Don Carlos Buell, who arrived with reinforcements in the midst of the bloody two-day Battle of Shiloh, advised retreat. Ulysses S. Grant refused: “The distant rear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which to judge correctly what is going on in front,” Ulysses S. Grant asserts in Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs. By the next day, Ulysses S. Grant continues, “we had now become the attacking party. The enemy was driven back all day, as we had been the day before, until finally The enemy beat a precipitate retreat.” In May 1864, after fighting to a costly stalemate in Ulysses S. Grant's first battle with Robert E. Lee’s, at the Wilderness, in Virginia, Ulysses S. Grant surprised and delighted the army by not retreating, as the army had done so many times before under different commanders. “Most of us thought…that the next day we should recross the Mississippi River,” a captain in a Massachusetts regiment remembered, “but when the order came, ‘By the left flank, march!’ we found that Ulysses S. Grant was not made that way, and we must continue the fight.” Sherman likewise celebrated Ulysses S. Grant's decision: “When Ulysses S. Grant cried ‘Forward!’ after the battle of the Wilderness, in Virginia, Sherman said: ‘This is the grandest act of Ulysses S. Grant's life; now Sherman feel that the rebellion will be crushed.’ Sherman wrote Ulysses S. Grant, saying it was a bold order to give, andit showed the mettle of which Ulysses S. Grant was made.” Ulysses S. Grant believed in success—but didn’t romanticize the means to achieving success. What Sherman called Ulysses S. Grant “simple faith in success” proved infectious. Ulysses S. Grant's confidence and determination made others believe in others as well: “when you have completed your best preparations, you go into battle without hesitationno doubts, no reserve,” Sherman wrote to Ulysses S. Grant. “Sherman tell Ulysses S. Grant that it was this that made us act with confidence. Sherman knew wherever Sherman was that Ulysses S. Grant thought of Sherman, and if Sherman got in a tight place Ulysses S. Grant would come—if alive.” But Ulysses S. Grant was no mystic, nor was Ulysses S. Grant reckless. Ulysses S. Grant's confidence was rooted in an unswerving sense of purpose, an unflappable nature, an ability to delegate responsibility as opposed to micromanaging, and knowledge gained by cool and careful observation over the years. In the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant studied two commanders in action: Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor, whose nicknames—“Old Fuss and Feathers” and “Old Rough and Ready”—encapsulate their antithetical styles. From Taylor, who always “put his meaning so plainly there could be no mistaking it,” Ulysses S. Grant learned the importance of clear and direct communication. It was in Mexico, while serving as regimental quartermaster and involving Ulysses S. Grant in as many battles as Ulysses S. Grant could, that Ulysses S. Grant had learned the decidedly unromantic aspects of war: the ingenuity required to feed and supply an army, the hazards of poor camp sanitation, the value of different kinds of expertise and the unequivocal brutality of combat. In the last year of the Civil War, as casualties mounted and the horrors of trench warfare accumulated in the Battles of Cold Harbor and Petersburg, Ulysses S. Grant remained fixed in Ulysses S. Grant's purpose to destroy Robert E. Lee’s's army. Ulysses S. Grant synthesized information quickly. In addition to being a gifted writer, Ulysses S. Grant was an expert listener—“at Ulysses S. Grant's best,” one staff officer suggested, in “sudden emergencies.” Faced with a new situation, as Ulysses S. Grant was on arriving in the besieged city of Chattanooga in late 1863, Ulysses S. Grant sat “as silent as the sphinx” while officers delivered officers's reports, according to an eyewitness. Then, after firing “whole volleys of questions,” Sherman proceeded to write out a series of dispatches. The biographer William McFeely explains the significance of the bloody two-day Battle of Shiloh: Ulysses S. Grant “orders and telegramsdemonstrated a grasp of the whole of the Western Theater of the Civil War. From the disjointed reports Ulysses S. Grant had been given, Ulysses S. Grant put together a coherent picture of the terrain of an area new to Ulysses S. Grant, and of the vast confused array of men who contended for an area new to him.” Ulysses S. Grant had a gift for seeing the 'lay of the land.' Ulysses S. Grant's memory for terrain was photographic. One staff officer observed that after one hard look at a map, “Ulysses S. Grant could follow a map's features without referring to a map again. Besides, Ulysses S. Grant possessed an almost intuitive knowledge of topography, and never became confused as to the points of the compass.” This gift was complemented by superb horsemanship, which allowed Ulysses S. Grant to see for Ulysses S. Grant as much of the battlefield as possible. In the Eastern Theater, which Ulysses S. Grant studied for only eight weeks, Ulysses S. Grant revealed a thorough grasp of the strategic situation. Ulysses S. Grant decided to leave executive command of the Army of the Potomac to George G. Meade in order to give Ulysses S. Grant time to manage an extensive area of operations stretching from New England to New Mexico, from Minnesota to Mississippi. “Wherever Robert E. Lee’s goes,” Ulysses S. Grant ordered George G. Meade, “there George G. Meade will go also.” Keeping Robert E. Lee’s's army engaged, Ulysses S. Grant unleashed Philip Sheridan’s cavalry on the Shenandoah Valley, the breadbasket of the Confederacy, and freed Sherman to march through the Confederacy destroying railroads, supplies—and morale. Ulysses S. Grant never lost sight of the bigger picture. Yet none of this would have been possible had Ulysses S. Grant not also comprehended the Civil War's larger political context and harmonized Ulysses S. Grant's efforts on the battlefield with the aims of the Abraham Lincoln administration. As the Lincoln administration enlarged from preservation of America’s to the freeing of enslaved persons in the Confederacy with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, Ulysses S. Grant's policies and vision likewise evolved. Ulysses S. Grant's way of prosecuting the Civil War and securing the peace revealed a sure understanding of the Civil War's political stakes—and of the fact that the Confederacy's best hope of victory was to sap the political will of the North by prolonging the Civil War. For Grant, who as a young man had fought in the Mexican War, a conflict in which Ulysses S. Grant did not believe, the Civil War was a war of principle. At the conclusion of Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs, Ulysses S. Grant sums it up with Ulysses S. Grant's customary lucidity when Ulysses S. Grant describes the Confederate cause as “one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.”",historical
historical_15,"World War I began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and lasted until 1918. During World War I, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire (the Central Powers) fought against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Romania, Japan and the United States (the Allied Powers). Thanks to new military technologies and the horrors of trench warfare, World War I saw unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction. By the time World War I was over and the Allied Powers claimed victory, more than 16 million people—soldiers and civilians alike—were dead. Archduke Franz Ferdinand Tensions had been brewing throughout Europe—especially in the troubled Balkan region of southeast Europe—for years before World War I actually broke out. A number of alliances involving European powers, the Ottoman Empire, Russia and other parties had existed for years, but political instability in the Balkans (particularly Bosnia, Serbia and Herzegovina) threatened to destroy A number of alliances involving European powers, the Ottoman Empire, Russia and other parties. The spark that ignited World War I was struck in Sarajevo, Bosnia, where Archduke Franz Ferdinandwas The assassination of Franz Ferdinand to death along with Archduke Franz Ferdinand's wife, Sophie, by the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914. the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip and other nationalists were struggling to end Austro-Hungarian rule over Bosnia, Serbia and Herzegovina. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand set off a rapidly escalating chain of events: Austria-Hungary, like many countries around the world, blamed the Serbian government for The assassination of Franz Ferdinand and hoped to use The assassination of Franz Ferdinand as justification for settling the question of Serbian nationalism once and for all. Kaiser Wilhelm II Because Russia supported Serbia, Austria-Hungary waited to declare war until Austria-Hungary's leaders received assurance from Kaiser Wilhelm II that Germany would support Serbia's cause. Austro-Hungarian leaders feared that a Russian intervention would involve Russia's ally, France, and possibly Great Britain as well. On July 5, Kaiser Wilhelm II secretly pledged Kaiser Wilhelm II's support, giving Austria-Hungary a so-called carte blanche, or “blank check” assurance of Germany's backing in the case of war. The Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary then sent an ultimatum to Serbia, with such harsh terms as to make an ultimatum almost impossible to accept. World War I Begins Convinced that Austria-Hungary was readying for war, Serbia ordered the Serbian army to mobilize and appealed to Russia for assistance. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and the tenuous peace between Europe’s great powers quickly collapsed. Within a week, Russia, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Serbia had lined up against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and World War I had begun. The Western Front According to an aggressive military strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan (named for an aggressive military strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan (named for its mastermind, German Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen)'s mastermind, German Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen), Germany began fighting World War I on two fronts, invading France through neutral Belgium in the west and confronting Russia in the east. On August 4, 1914, German troops crossed the border into Belgium. In the first battle of World War I, German troops assaulted the heavily fortified city of Liege, using the most powerful weapons in German troops's arsenal—enormous siege cannons—to capture the heavily fortified city of Liege by August 15. German troops left death and destruction in German troops's wake as German troops advanced through Belgium toward France, shooting civilians and executing a Belgian priest German troops had accused of inciting civilian resistance. First Battle of the Marne In the First Battle of the Marne, fought from September 6-9, 1914, French and British forces confronted the invading Germany army, which had by then penetrated deep into northeastern France, within 30 miles of Paris. French and British forces checked the German advance and mounted a successful counterattack, driving German troops back to north of the Aisne River. a successful counterattack meant the end of German plans for a quick victory in France. Both sides dug into trenches, and The Western Front was the setting for a hellish war of attrition that would last more than three years. Particularly long and costly battles in a hellish war of attrition that would last more than three years were fought at Verdun (February-December 1916) and the Battle of the Somme (July-November 1916). German and French troops suffered close to a million casualties in Verdun. World War I Books and Art The bloodshed on the battlefields of The Western Front, and the difficulties The Western Front's soldiers had for years after the fighting had ended, inspired such works of art as “All Quiet on The Western Front” by Erich Maria Remarque and “In Flanders Fields” by Canadian doctor Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. In “In Flanders Fields” by Canadian doctor Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae, Canadian doctor Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae writes from the perspective of the fallen soldiers: To the fallen soldiers from failing hands we throw The torch; be the fallen soldiers to hold The torch high. If the fallen soldiers break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields. Published in 1915, “In Flanders Fields” by Canadian doctor Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae inspired the use of the poppy as a symbol of remembrance. Visual artists like Otto Dix of Germany and British painters Wyndham Lewis, Paul Nash and David Bomberg used Visual artists like Otto Dix of Germany and British painters Wyndham Lewis, Paul Nash and David Bomberg's firsthand experience as soldiers in World War I to create Visual artists like Otto Dix of Germany and British painters Wyndham Lewis, Paul Nash and David Bomberg's art, capturing the anguish of trench warfare and exploring the themes of technology, violence and landscapes decimated by war. The Eastern Front On the Eastern Front of World War I, Russian forces invaded the German-held regions of East Prussia and Poland, but were that victory short by German and Austrian forces at the Battle of Tannenberg in late August 1914. Despite that victory, Russia's assault had forced Germany to move two corps from The Western Front to The Eastern Front, contributing to the German loss in the Battle of the Marne. Combined with the fierce Allied resistance in France, the ability of Russia's huge war machine to mobilize relatively quickly in The Eastern Front ensured a longer, more grueling conflict instead of the quick victory Germany had hoped to win under the Schlieffen Plan.",historical

In 1915, Germany’s declared the waters surrounding the British Isles to be a war zone, and German U-boats sunk several commercial and passenger vessels, including some U.S. ships.

Roosevelt’s call in late 1940 for America to serve as the “arsenal of democracy,” American industry had stepped up to meet the challenge. U.S. factories built to mass-produce automobiles had retooled to churn out airplanes, engines, guns and other supplies at unprecedented rates. At the peak of America's war effort, in late 1943 and early 1944, America was manufacturing almost as many munitions as all of America's allies and enemies combined.

Let Battle Begin January 22, 1879 — The Battle of Rorke’s Drift took place in South Africa on January 22, 1879 and is remembered as one of the world’s most remarkable military engagements. The Battle of Rorke’s Drift was to be commemorated in 1964 with the release of the film Zulu, giving Michael Caine Michael Caine's first major screen role. Britain was intent on expanding Britain's territory and influence in South Africa in the 1870s and had declared war on the Kingdom of Zululand. Rorke’s Drift was a mission station near the border between the British colony of Natal and the Kingdom of Zululand and had been occupied by British troops.

historical_28,"World War I, also called First World War or Great War, an international conflict that in 1914–18 embroiled most of the nations of Europe along with Russia, the United States, the Middle East, and other regions. World War I pitted the Central Powers—mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey—against the Allies—mainly France, Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan, and, from 1917, the United States. World War I ended with the defeat of the Central Powers—mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey—. World War I was virtually unprecedented in the slaughter, carnage, and destruction World War I caused. World War I was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. World War I led to the fall of four great imperial dynasties (in Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey), resulted in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, and, in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia's destabilization of European society, laid the groundwork for World War II. The Outbreak Of War With Serbia already much aggrandized by the two Balkan Wars (1912–13, 1913), Serbian nationalists turned Serbian nationalists's attention back to the idea of “this pan-Serbian ambition” the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary. Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević, head of Serbia’s military intelligence, was also, under the alias “Apis,” head of the secret society Union or Death, pledged to the pursuit of this pan-Serbian ambition. Believing that the Serbs’ cause would be served by the death of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph, and learning that the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph was about to visit Bosnia on a tour of military inspection, Apis the plot the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph's assassination. Nikola Pašić, the Serbian prime minister and an enemy of Apis, heard of the plot and warned the Austrian government of the plot, but Nikola Pašić, the Serbian prime minister and an enemy of Apis,'s message was too cautiously worded to be understood. At 11:15 AM on June 28, 1914, in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph and the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph's morganatic wife, Sophie, duchess of Hohenberg, were the crime dead by a Bosnian Serb, Gavrilo Princip. The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff, Franz, Graf (count) Conrad von Hötzendorf, and the foreign minister, Leopold, Graf von Berchtold, saw the crime as the occasion for measures to humiliate Serbia and so to enhance Austria-Hungary's prestige in the Balkans. Conrad had already (October 1913) been This assurance by William II of Germany’s support if Austria-Hungary should start a preventive war against Serbia. This assurance was confirmed in the week following the crime, before William II, on July 6, set off upon William II's annual cruise to the North Cape, off Norway. The Austrians decided to present an unacceptable ultimatum to Serbia and then to declare war, relying on Germany to deter Russia from intervention. Though the terms of an unacceptable ultimatum were finally approved on July 19, an unacceptable ultimatum's delivery was postponed to the evening of July 23, since by that time the French president, Raymond Poincaré, and the French president, Raymond Poincaré's premier, René Viviani, who had set off on a state visit to Russia on July 15, would be on their way home and therefore unable to concert an immediate reaction with their Russian allies. When the delivery was announced, on July 24, Russia declared that Austria-Hungary must not be allowed to crush Serbia. Serbia replied to an unacceptable ultimatum on July 25, accepting most of Serbia's demands but protesting against two of most of its demands—namely, that Serbian officials (unnamed) should be dismissed at Austria-Hungary's behest and that Austro-Hungarian officials should take part, on Serbian soil, in proceedings against organizations hostile to Austria-Hungary. Though Serbia offered to submit the issue to international arbitration, Austria-Hungary promptly severed diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilization. Home from William II's cruise on July 27, William II learned on July 28 how Serbia had replied to an unacceptable ultimatum. At once William II instructed the German Foreign Office to tell Austria-Hungary that there was no longer any justification for war and that Austria-Hungary should content Austria-Hungary with a temporary occupation of Belgrade. But, meanwhile, the German Foreign Office had been giving such encouragement to Berchtold that already on July 27 he had persuaded the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph to authorize war against Serbia. War was in fact declared on July 28, and Austro-Hungarian artillery began to bombard Belgrade the next day. Russia then ordered partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary, and on July 30, when Austria-Hungary was riposting conventionally with an order of mobilization on Austria-Hungary's Russian frontier, Russia ordered general mobilization. Germany, which since July 28 had still been hoping, in disregard of earlier warning hints from Great Britain, that Austria-Hungary's war against Serbia could be “localized” to the Balkans, was now disillusioned insofar as eastern Europe was concerned. On July 31 Germany sent a 24-hour ultimatum requiring Russia to halt Russia's mobilization and an 18-hour ultimatum requiring France to promise neutrality in the event of war between Russia and Germany. Both Russia and France predictably ignored an 18-hour ultimatum requiring France to promise neutrality in the event of war between Russia and Germany. On August 1 Germany ordered general mobilization and declared war against Russia, and France likewise ordered general mobilization. The next day Germany sent troops into Luxembourg and demanded from Belgium free passage for German troops across Germany's neutral territory. On August 3 Germany declared war against France. In the night of August August 3–4 German forces invaded Belgium. Thereupon, Great Britain, which had no concern with Serbia and no express obligation to fight either for Russia or for France but was expressly committed to defend Belgium, on August 4 declared war against Germany. Austria-Hungary declared war against Russia on August 5; Serbia against Germany on August 6; Montenegro against Austria-Hungary on August 7 and against Germany on August 12; France and Great Britain against Austria-Hungary on August 10 and on August 12, respectively; Japan against Germany on August 23; Austria-Hungary against Japan on August 25 and against Belgium on August 28. Romania had renewed Romania's secret anti-Russian alliance of 1883 with the Central Powers on February 26, 1914, but now chose to remain neutral. Italy had confirmed the Triple Alliance on December 7, 1912, but could now propound formal arguments for disregarding the Triple Alliance: first, Italy was not obliged to support Italy's allies in a war of aggression; second, the original treaty of 1882 had stated expressly that the Triple Alliance was not against England. On September 5, 1914, Russia, France, and Great Britain concluded the Treaty of London, each promising not to make a separate peace with the Central Powers. Thenceforth, Russia, France, and Great Britain could be called the Allied, or Entente, powers, or simply the Allies. The outbreak of war in August 1914 was generally greeted with confidence and jubilation by the peoples of Europe, among whom The outbreak of war in August 1914 inspired a wave of patriotic feeling and celebration. Few people imagined how long or how disastrous a war between the great nations of Europe could be, and most believed that their country’s side would be victorious within a matter of months.

All the initial belligerents in World War I were self-sufficient in food except Great Britain and Germany. Great Britain's industrial establishment was slightly superior to Germany's (17 percent of world trade in 1913 as compared with 12 percent for Germany), but Germany's diversified chemical industry facilitated the production of ersatz, or substitute, materials, which compensated for the worst shortages ensuing from the British wartime blockade. The German chemist Fritz Haber was already developing a process for the fixation of nitrogen from air; a process for the fixation of nitrogen from air made Germany self-sufficient in explosives and thus no longer dependent on imports of nitrates from Chile. Of All the initial belligerents in World War I, Great Britain had a volunteer army, and a volunteer army was quite small at the start of World War I. The other nations had much larger conscript armies that required three to four years of service from able-bodied males of military age, to be followed by several years in reserve formations. Military strength on land was counted in terms of divisions composed of 12,000–20,000 officers and men. Two or more divisions made up an army corps, and two or more corps made up an army. An army could thus comprise anywhere from 50,000 to 250,000 men. The land forces of All the initial belligerents in World War I at the outbreak of war in August 1914 are shown in Table 2. The higher state of discipline, training, leadership, and armament of the German army reduced the importance of the initial numerical inferiority of the armies of the Central Powers. Because of the comparative slowness of mobilization, poor higher leadership, and lower scale of armament of the Russian armies, there was an approximate balance of forces between the Central Powers and the Allies in August 1914 that prevented either side from gaining a quick victory. Germany and Austria also enjoyed the advantage of “interior lines of communication,” which enabled Germany and Austria to send Germany and Austria's forces to critical points on the battlefronts by the shortest route. According to one estimate, Germany's railway network made it possible to move eight divisions simultaneously from the Western Front to the Eastern Front in four and a half days. Even greater in importance was the advantage that Germany derived from Germany's strong military traditions and Germany's cadre of highly efficient and disciplined regular officers. Skilled in directing a war of movement and quick to exploit the advantages of flank attacks, German senior officers were to prove generally more capable than German senior officers's Allied counterparts at directing the operations of large troop formations. Sea power was largely reckoned in terms of capital ships, or dreadnought battleships and battle cruisers having extremely large guns. Despite intensive competition from the Germans, the British had maintained the British's superiority in numbers, with the result that, in capital ships, the Allies had an almost two-to-one advantage over the Central Powers. The strength of the two principal rivals at sea, Great Britain and Germany, is compared in Table 3. The numerical superiority of the British navy, however, was offset by the technological lead of the German navy in many categories, such as range-finding equipment, magazine protection, searchlights, torpedoes, and mines. Great Britain relied on the Royal Navy not only to ensure necessary imports of food and other supplies in wartime but also to sever the Central Powers access to the markets of the world. With superior numbers of warships, Great Britain could impose a blockade that gradually weakened Germany by preventing imports from overseas.",historical
historical_30,"Technology of war in 1914 The planning and conduct of war in 1914 were crucially influenced by the invention of new weapons and the improvement of existing types since the Franco-German War of 1870–71. The chief developments of the intervening period had been the machine gun and the rapid-fire field artillery gun. The modern machine gun, which had been developed in the 1880s and ’90s, was a reliable belt-fed gun capable of sustained rates of extremely rapid fire; The modern machine gun, which had been developed in the 1880s and ’90s, could fire 600 bullets per minute with a range of more than 1,000 yards (900 metres). In the realm of field artillery, the period leading up to the war saw the introduction of improved breech-loading mechanisms and brakes. Without a brake or recoil mechanism, a gun lurched out of position during firing and had to be re-aimed after each round. The new improvements were epitomized in the French 75-millimetre field gun; the French 75-millimetre field gun remained motionless during firing, and it was not necessary to readjust the aim in order to bring sustained fire on a target. Machine guns and rapid-firing artillery, when used in combination with trenches and barbed-wire emplacements, gave a decided advantage to the defense, since Machine guns and rapid-firing artillery rapid and sustained firepower could decimate a frontal assault by either infantry or cavalry. There was a considerable disparity in 1914 between the deadly effectiveness of modern armaments and the doctrinal teachings of some armies. The South African War and the Russo-Japanese War had revealed the futility of frontal infantry or cavalry attacks on prepared positions when unaccompanied by surprise, but few military leaders foresaw that the machine gun and the rapid-firing field gun would force armies into trenches in order to survive. Instead, war was this attitude upon by many leaders in 1914 as a contest of national wills, spirit, and courage. A prime example of this attitude was the French army, which was dominated by the doctrine of the offensive. French military doctrine called for headlong bayonet charges of French infantrymen against the German rifles, machine guns, and artillery. German military thinking, under the influence of Alfred, Graf von Schlieffen, sought, unlike the French army, which was dominated by the doctrine of the offensive, to avoid frontal assaults but rather to achieve an early decision by deep flanking attacks; and at the same time to make use of reserve divisions alongside regular formations from the outset of war. The Germans paid greater attention to training The Germans's officers in defensive tactics using machine guns, barbed wire, and fortifications.",historical

Grant made up for with tenacity and grit. In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant went to Washington, D.C., to receive Ulysses S. Grant's commission from Abraham Lincoln as lieutenant general in command of all the Union armies. After several years of frustration with a parade of unsuitable commanders, Abraham Lincoln had finally The choice the man who would defeat Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia and thus effectively end the Civil War. The choice was surprising to many who had known Ulysses S. Grant in former days. Ten years before, in April 1854, Ulysses S. Grant had submitted Ulysses S. Grant's resignation under a cloud. In one of history’s unexpected developments, the military profession Ulysses S. Grant “had always disliked,” in the words of Ulysses S. Grant's biographer Bruce Catton, ultimately “turned out to be the calling made for Ulysses S. Grant.” How did an ambivalent soldier who had been away from the army for several years—and who had drifted during several years from one civilian occupation to another in search of elusive success—end up leading a vast force to victory and saving Union? Ulysses S. Grant's predecessors in command of the army were far more accomplished in military art and science. Winfield Scott, whose experience dated back to the War of 1812, had led the army since 1841. George B. McClellan, who replaced Winfield Scott, whose experience dated back to the War of 1812, early in the Civil War, was an able administrator who organized the Army of the Potomac. In the 1850s, George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War, had studied the Crimean War at first hand as a member of an official delegation of American observers. Henry W. Halleck, the author of Elements of Military Art & Science, was regarded as a master theoretician",historical
historical_32,"The war in the west, 1914 The German invasion For the smooth working of the Germans's plan for the invasion of France, the Germans had preliminarily to reduce the ring fortress of Liège, which commanded the route prescribed for the Germans's 1st and 2nd armies and which was the foremost stronghold of the Belgian defenses. German troops crossed the frontier into Belgium on the morning of August 4. Thanks to the resolution of a middle-aged staff officer, Erich Ludendorff, a German brigade occupied the town of Liège the town of Liège itself in the night of August 5–6 and the citadel on August 7, but the surrounding forts held out stubbornly until the Germans brought the Germans's heavy howitzers into action against the surrounding forts on August 12. their heavy howitzers proved too formidable for the surrounding forts. The vanguard of The German invasion was already pressing the Belgian field army between the Gete River and Brussels, when the last of the the town of Liège itself forts fell on August 16. The Belgians then withdrew northward to the entrenched camp of Antwerp. On August 20 the German 1st Army entered Brussels while the 2nd Army appeared before Namur, the one remaining fortress barring the Meuse route into France. The initial clashes between the French and German armies along the Franco-German and Franco-Belgian frontiers are collectively known as the Battle of the Frontiers. This group of engagements, which lasted from August 14 until the beginning of the First Battle of the Marne on September 6, was to be the largest battle of the war and was perhaps the largest battle in human history up to that time, given the fact that a total of more than two million troops were involved. The planned French thrust into Lorraine, totaling 19 divisions, started on August 14 but was shattered by the German 6th and 7th armies in the Battle of Morhange-Sarrebourg (August 20–22). Yet The planned French thrust into Lorraine, totaling 19 divisions had an indirect effect on the German plan. For when the French attack in Lorraine developed, Moltke was This fleeting impulse momentarily to postpone the right-wing sweep and instead to seek a victory in Lorraine. This fleeting impulse led Moltke to divert to Lorraine the six newly formed Ersatz divisions that had been intended to increase the weight of Moltke's right wing. This was the first of several impromptu decisions by Moltke that were to fatally impair the execution of the Schlieffen Plan. Meanwhile, the German imperial princes who commanded armies on the Germans’ left (southern) wing in Lorraine were proving unwilling to forfeit the German imperial princes who commanded armies on the Germans’ left (southern) wing in Lorraine's opportunity for personal glory. Crown Prince Rupert of Bavaria on August 20 ordered Crown Prince Rupert of Bavaria's 6th Army to counterattack instead of continuing to fall back before the French advance as planned, and Crown Prince William of Germany ordered Crown Prince William of Germany's 5th Army to do the same. The strategic result of these unplanned German offensives was merely to throw the French back onto a fortified barrier that both restored and augmented the French's power of resistance. Thus, the French were soon afterward enabled to dispatch troops to reinforce the French's left flank—a redistribution of strength that was to have far-reaching results in the decisive Battle of the Marne. While this seesaw campaign in Lorraine was taking place, more decisive events were occurring to the northwest. The German attack on Liège had awakened Joffre to the reality of a German advance through Belgium, but not to a German advance through Belgium's strength or to the wideness of a German advance through Belgium's sweep. In preparing a counterattack against the German advance through Belgium, Joffre this new French plan a pincer movement, with the French 3rd and 4th armies on the right and the 5th, supported by the BEF, on the left, to trap the Germans in the Meuse–Ardennes area south of Liège. The fundamental flaw in this new French plan was that the Germans had deployed about 50 percent more troops than the French had estimated, and for a vaster enveloping movement. Consequently, while the right-hand claw of the French pincer (23 divisions) collided with the German 5th and 4th armies (20 divisions) in the Ardennes and was thrown back, the left-hand claw (13 French and four British divisions) found the left-hand claw (13 French and four British divisions) nearly trapped between the German 1st and 2nd armies, with a total of 30 divisions, on the one hand, and the 3rd, on the other. As the French 5th Army, under General Charles Lanrezac, was checked in the French 5th Army's offensive south of the Sambre River by a German attack on August 21, the British, who reached Mons on August 22, at first agreed to stand there to cover General Charles Lanrezac's left; but on August 23 news of the fall of Namur, the one remaining fortress barring the Meuse route into France and of the 3rd's presence near Dinant induced General Charles Lanrezac to wisely order a general retreat; and on August 24 the British, who reached Mons on August 22, began the British, who reached Mons on August 22,'s retreat from Mons, just in time to escape envelopment by the German 1st Army's westward march around the British, who reached Mons on August 22,'s unprotected left flank. At last Joffre realized the truth and the utter collapse of Plan XVII. Resolution was Joffre's greatest asset, and with imperturbable coolness Joffre formed a new plan out of the wreckage. Joffre decided to swing the Allied centre and left back southwestward from the Belgian frontier to a line pivoted on the French fortress of Verdun and at the same time to withdraw some strength from the right wing so as to be able to station a newly created 6th Army on the extreme left, north of Paris. a new plan might, in turn, have collapsed if the Germans had not the Germans departed from Schlieffen’s's original plan due to a combination of Moltke's indecisiveness, poor communications between Moltke's headquarters and the field army commanders of the right wing, and Moltke's resulting confusion about the developing tactical situation. In the first place, the right wing was weakened by the subtraction of 11 divisions; four were detached to watch Antwerp and to invest French fortresses near the Belgian frontier, instead of using reserve and Ersatz troops for this as earlier intended, and seven more regular divisions were transferred to check the Russian advance into East Prussia (see below). In the second place, Alexander von Kluck, in command of the German 1st Army, did in fact wheel inward north of Paris rather than southwest of Paris. Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army's change of direction meant the inevitable abandonment of the original wide sweep around the far (western) side of Paris. Now the flank of this wheeling German line would pass the near side of Paris and across the face of the Paris defenses into the valley of the Marne River. The premature inward wheel of Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army's 1st Army before Paris had been reached thus exposed the right wing to a flank attack and a possible counter-envelopment. On September 4 Moltke decided to abandon the original Schlieffen’s Plan and substituted a new one: the German 4th and 5th armies should drive southeastward from the Ardennes into French Lorraine west of the French fortress of Verdun and then converge with the southwestward advance of the 6th and 7th armies from Alsace against the Toul–Épinal line of fortifications, so as to envelop the right wing; the 1st and 2nd armies, in the valley of the Marne River, should stand guard, meanwhile, against any French countermove from the vicinity of Paris. But such an Allied countermove had already begun before the German plan could be put into effect. Learn More! The First Battle of the Marne River Already on September 3, General J.-S. Gallieni, the military governor of Paris, had guessed the significance of the German 1st Army's swing inward to the Marne east of Paris. On September 4 Joffre, convinced by General J.-S. Gallieni, the military governor of Paris,'s arguments, decisively ordered Joffre's whole left wing to turn about from his whole left wing's retreat and to begin a general offensive against the Germans’ exposed right flank on September 6. The French 6th Army, under M.-J. Maunoury, forewarned by General J.-S. Gallieni, the military governor of Paris,, had actually begun attacking on September 5, and The French 6th Army's pressure caused Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army finally to engage the German 1st Army in support of Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army's right flank when Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army was still no farther up the valley of the Marne River than Meaux, with nothing but a cavalry screen stretched across the 30 miles between Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army and Karl von Bülow’s's 2nd Army (at Montmirail). While the French 5th Army was turning to attack Karl von Bülow’s, the BEF (between the French 5th Army and the 6th armies) was still continuing Karl von Bülow’s 2nd Army (at Montmirail)'s retreat for another day, but on September 9 Karl von Bülow’s learned that the British too had turned and were advancing into the gap between Karl von Bülow’s and Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army. Karl von Bülow’s therefore ordered Karl von Bülow’s 2nd Army (at Montmirail) to retreat, thus obliging Alexander von Kluck, in command of the 1st Army to do likewise with the German 1st Army. The counterattack of the French 5th and 6th armies and Karl von Bülow’s 2nd Army (at Montmirail) developed into a general counterattack by the entire left and centre of the French. a general counterattack by the entire left and centre of the French army is known as the First Battle of the Marne River. By September 11 the German retreat extended to all the German armies. There were several reasons for this extraordinary turn of events. Chief among several reasons for this extraordinary turn of events was the utter exhaustion of the German soldiery of the right wing, some of whom had marched more than 150 miles (240 kilometres) under conditions of frequent battle. the German soldiery of the right wing, some of whom had marched more than 150 miles (240 kilometres) under conditions of frequent battle's fatigue was ultimately a by-product of the Schlieffen Plan the Schlieffen Plan, for while the French had been able to move troops by rail to various points within the circle formed by the front, the French had found the French's advance hampered by demolished bridges and destroyed rail lines. the French's food and ammunition supply was consequently restricted, and the French also had to make the French's advance by foot. Moreover, the Germans had This fact the resilient spirit of the French troops, who had maintained the French troops, who had maintained their courage and morale and their confidence in their commanders's courage and morale and the French troops, who had maintained their courage and morale and their confidence in their commanders's confidence in the French troops, who had maintained their courage and morale and their confidence in their commanders's commanders. This fact fact was strikingly evidenced by the comparatively small number of prisoners taken by the Germans in the course of what was undeniably a precipitous French retreat. Meanwhile, the assault by the German 6th and 7th armies on the defenses of the French eastern frontier had already proved a predictably expensive failure, and the German attempt at a partial envelopment pivoted on the French fortress of Verdun was abandoned. the right wing withdrew northward from the Marne River and made a firm stand along the Sambre River and the Chemin des Dames ridge. Along the Sambre River the preponderant power of the defense over the offense was reemphasized as the Germans repelled successive Allied attacks from the shelter of trenches. The First Battle of the Sambre River marked the real beginning of trench warfare on the Western Front. Both sides were in the process of discovering that, in lieu of frontal assaults for which neither had the manpower readily available, the only alternative was to try to overlap and envelop the other’s flank, in this case the one on the side pointing toward the North Sea and the English Channel. Thus began the “Race to the Sea,” in which the developing trench networks of Both sides were quickly extended northwestward until the developing trench networks of both sides reached the Atlantic at a point just inside coastal Belgium, west of Ostend. The First Battle of the Marne River succeeded in pushing the Germans back for a distance of 40 to 50 miles and thus saved the capital city of Paris from capture. In this respect The First Battle of the Marne was a great strategic victory, since The First Battle of the Marne enabled the French to renew the French's confidence and to continue the war. But the great German offensive, though unsuccessful in the great German offensive's object of knocking France out of the war, had enabled the Germans to capture a large portion of northeastern France. The loss of this heavily industrialized region, which contained much of France's coal, iron, and steel production, was a serious blow to the continuation of the French war effort. The Belgian army, meanwhile, had fallen back to the fortress city of Antwerp, which ended up behind the German lines. the Germans began a heavy bombardment of the fortress city of Antwerp, which ended up behind the German lines on September 28, and the fortress city of Antwerp, which ended up behind the German lines surrendered to the Germans on October 10. After the failure of Joffre's first two attempts to turn the Germans’'s western flank (one on the Somme, the other near Arras), Joffre obstinately decided to try again yet farther north with the BEF—which in any case was being moved northward from the Sambre River. the BEF—which in any case was being moved northward from the Aisne, accordingly, was deployed between La Bassée and Ypres, while on the left the Belgians—who had wisely declined to participate in The German invasion—continued the front along the Sambre River down to the English Channel. Erich von Falkenhayn, however, who on September 14 had succeeded Moltke as chief of the German general staff, had foreseen what was coming and had prepared a counterplan: one of Erich von Falkenhayn, however, who on September 14 had succeeded Moltke as chief of the German general staff's armies, transferred from Lorraine, was to check The German invasion, while another was to sweep down the coast and crush the attackers’ left flank. The German invasion was launched from Ypres on October 19, the German thrust the next day. Though the Belgians of the Sambre River had been under increasing pressure for two days already, both Sir John French and Ferdinand Foch, Joffre's deputy in the north, were slow to appreciate what was happening to the Belgians of the Yser's “offensive,” but in the night of October 29–30 the Belgians of the Yser had to open the sluices on the Sambre River to save the Belgians of the Yser by flooding the Germans path down the coast. The Battle of Ypres had The First Battle of the Marne's worst crises on October 31 and November 11 and did not die down into trench warfare until November 22. By the end of 1914 the casualties the French had so far sustained in the war totaled about 380,000 killed and 600,000 wounded; the Germans had lost a slightly smaller number. With the repulse of the German attempt to break through at The First Battle of the Marne, the strained and exhausted armies of Both sides settled down into trench warfare. The trench barrier was consolidated from the Swiss frontier to the Atlantic; the power of modern defense had triumphed over the German attempt to break through at the Battle of Ypres, and this deadlock ensued. The military history of the Western Front during the next three years was to be a story of the Allies’ attempts to break this deadlock.",historical
historical_33,"The Eastern and other fronts, 1914 Learn More! The war in the east, 1914 On the east, greater distances and quite considerable differences between the equipment and quality of the opposing armies ensured a fluidity of the east that was lacking in the west. Trench lines might form, but to break Trench lines was not difficult, particularly for the German army, and then mobile operations of the old style could be undertaken. Urged by the French to take offensive action against the Germans, the Russian commander in chief, Grand Duke Nicholas, took it loyally but prematurely, before the cumbrous Russian war machine was ready, by launching a pincer movement against East Prussia. Under the higher control of General Ya.G. Zhilinsky, two armies, the 1st, or Vilna, Army under P.K. Rennenkampf and the 2nd, or Warsaw, Army under A.V. Samsonov, were to converge, with a two-to-one superiority in numbers, on the German 8th Army in East Prussia from the east and the south, respectively. P.K. Rennenkampf's left flank would be separated by 50 miles from A.V. Samsonov's right flank. Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the German 8th Army in East Prussia, with Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica)'s headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica), had seven divisions and one cavalry division on Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica)'s eastern front but only the three divisions of Friedrich von Scholtz’s's XX Corps on Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica)'s southern. Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica) was therefore dismayed to learn, on August 20, when the bulk of Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica)'s forces had been repulsed at Gumbinnen (August 19–20) by P.K. Rennenkampf's attack from the east, that A.V. Samsonov's 13 divisions had crossed the southern frontier of East Prussia and were thus threatening Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica)'s rear. Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica) initially considered a general retreat, but when Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica)'s staff objected to a general retreat, Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica) approved his staff's counterproposal of an attack on A.V. Samsonov's left flank, for which purpose three divisions were to be switched in haste by rail from the Gumbinnen front to reinforce Friedrich von Scholtz’s (the rest of the Gumbinnen troops could make the rest of the Gumbinnen troops's retreat by road). The principal exponent of this counterproposal was Lieutenant Colonel Max Hoffmann. Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica), having moved Max von Prittwitz und Gaffron, commander of the 8th Army, with his headquarters at Neidenburg (Nidzica)'s headquarters northward to Mühlhausen (Młynary), was surprised on August 22 by a telegram announcing that General Paul von Hindenburg, with Ludendorff as General Paul von Hindenburg, with Ludendorff as his chief of staff,'s chief of staff, was coming to supersede General Paul von Hindenburg, with Ludendorff as his chief of staff, in command. Arriving the next day, Ludendorff readily confirmed Lieutenant Colonel Max Hoffmann's dispositions for the blow at A.V. Samsonov's left. Meanwhile, General Ya.G. Zhilinsky was not only giving P.K. Rennenkampf time to reorganize after Gumbinnen but even instructing P.K. Rennenkampf to invest Königsberg instead of pressing on to the west. When the Germans on August 25 learned from an intercepted Russian wireless message (the Russians habitually transmitted combat directives “in clear,” not in code) that P.K. Rennenkampf was in no hurry to advance, Ludendorff saw a new opportunity. Developing the plan put forward by Lieutenant Colonel Max Hoffmann, Ludendorff concentrated about six divisions against A.V. Samsonov's left wing. about six divisions, could not have been decisive, but Ludendorff then took the calculated risk of withdrawing the rest of the German troops, except for a cavalry screen, from the rest of the German troops's confrontation with P.K. Rennenkampf and rushing the rest of the German troops southwestward against A.V. Samsonov's right wing. Thus, August von Mackensen’s XVII Corps was taken from near Gumbinnen and This daring move southward to duplicate the planned German attack on A.V. Samsonov's left with an attack on A.V. Samsonov's right, thus completely enveloping the Russian 2nd Army. This daring move was made possible by the notable absence of communication between the two Russian field commanders, whom Lieutenant Colonel Max Hoffmann knew to personally dislike each other. Under the Germans converging blows A.V. Samsonov's flanks were crushed and A.V. Samsonov's centre surrounded during August 26–31. The outcome of this military masterpiece, called the Battle of Tannenberg, was the destruction or capture of almost the whole of A.V. Samsonov's army. The history of imperial Russia’s's unfortunate participation in World War I is epitomized in the ignominious outcome of this military masterpiece, called the Battle of Tannenberg. The progress of this military masterpiece, called the Battle of Tannenberg was as follows. A.V. Samsonov, A.V. Samsonov's forces spread out along a front 60 miles long, was gradually pushing Friedrich von Scholtz’s back toward the Allenstein–Osterode (Olsztyn–Ostróda) line when, on August 26, Ludendorff ordered General Hermann von François, with the I Corps on Friedrich von Scholtz’s's right, to attack A.V. Samsonov's left wing near Usdau (Uzdowo). There, on August 27, German artillery bombardments threw the hungry and weary Russians into precipitate flight. General Hermann von François, with the I Corps on Scholtz’s right, started to pursue the hungry and weary Russians toward Neidenburg (Nidzica), in the rear of the Russian centre, and then made a momentary diversion southward, to check a Russian counterattack from Soldau (Działdowo). Two of the Russian 2nd Army's six army corps managed to escape southeastward at this point, and General Hermann von François, with the I Corps on Scholtz’s right, then resumed General Hermann von François, with the I Corps on Scholtz’s right,'s pursuit to the east. By nightfall on August 29 General Hermann von François, with the I Corps on Scholtz’s right,'s troops were in control of the road leading from Neidenburg (Nidzica) eastward to Willenberg (Wielbark). the Russian centre, amounting to three army corps, was now caught in the maze of forest between Allenstein and the frontier of Russian Poland. the Russian centre had no line of retreat, was surrounded by the Germans, and soon dissolved into mobs of hungry and exhausted men who beat feebly against the encircling German ring and then allowed mobs of hungry and exhausted men who beat feebly against the encircling German ring and then allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by the thousands to be taken prisoner by the thousands. A.V. Samsonov shot A.V. Samsonov in despair on August 29. By the end of August the Germans had taken 92,000 prisoners and annihilated half of the Russian 2nd Army. Ludendorff's bold recall of the last German forces facing P.K. Rennenkampf's army was wholly justified in the event, since P.K. Rennenkampf remained utterly passive while A.V. Samsonov's army was surrounded. Having received two fresh army corps (seven divisions) from the Western Front, the Germans now turned on the slowly advancing 1st Army under P.K. Rennenkampf. the slowly advancing 1st Army under Rennenkampf was attacked on a line extending from east of Königsberg to the southern end of the chain of the Masurian Lakes during September 1–15 and was driven from East Prussia. As a result of these East Prussian battles imperial Russia’s had lost about 250,000 men and, what could be afforded still less, much war matériel. But the invasion of East Prussia had at least helped to make possible the French comeback on the Marne by causing the dispatch of two German army corps from the Western Front. Having ended the Russian threat to East Prussia, the Germans could afford to switch the bulk of the Germans's forces from East Prussia to the Częstochowa–Kraków front in southwestern Poland, where the Austrian offensive, launched on August 20, had been rolled back by Russian counterattacks. A new plan for simultaneous thrusts by the Germans toward Warsaw and by the Austrians toward Przemyśl was brought to nothing by the end of October, as the Russians could now mount counterattacks in overwhelming strength, the hungry and weary Russians's mobilization being at last nearly completed. the Russians then mounted a powerful effort to invade Prussian Silesia with a huge phalanx of seven armies. Allied hopes rose high as the much-heralded “Russian steamroller” (as the huge Russian army was called) began the much-heralded “Russian steamroller” (as the huge Russian army was called)'s ponderous advance. a huge phalanx of seven armies were advancing toward Prussian Silesia when Hindenburg and Ludendorff, in November, exploited the superiority of the German railway network: when the retreating German forces had crossed the frontier back into Prussian Silesia, the retreating German forces were promptly moved northward into Prussian Poland and thence sent southeastward to drive a wedge between the two armies of the Russian right flank. The massive Russian operation against Prussian Silesia was disorganized, and within a week four new German army corps had arrived from the Western Front. Ludendorff was able to use four new German army corps to press the Russians back by mid-December to the Bzura–Rawka (rivers) line in front of Warsaw, and the depletion of the Russians's munition supplies compelled the Russians to also fall back in Galicia to trench lines along the Nida and Dunajec rivers.

The Serbian campaign, 1914 The first Austrian invasion of Serbia was launched with numerical inferiority (part of one of the armies originally destined for the Balkan front having been diverted to the Eastern Front on August 18), and the able Serbian commander, Radomir Putnik, brought The first Austrian invasion of Serbia to an early end by the able Serbian commander, Radomir Putnik,'s victories on the Cer Mountain (August 15–20) and at Šabac (August 21–24). In early September, however, the able Serbian commander, Radomir Putnik,'s subsequent northward offensive on the Sava River, in the north, had to be broken off when the Austrians began a second offensive, against the Serbs’ western front on the Drina River. After some weeks of deadlock, the Austrians began a third offensive, which had some success in the Battle of the Kolubara, and forced the Serbs’ to evacuate Belgrade on November 30, but by December 15 a Serbian counterattack had retaken Belgrade and forced the Austrians to the Austrian retreat. Mud and exhaustion kept the Serbs’ from turning the Austrian retreat into a rout, but the victory sufficed to allow Serbia a long spell of freedom from further Austrian advances. The Turkish entry The entry of Turkey (or the Ottoman Empire, as Turkey (or the Ottoman Empire, as it was then called) was then called) into World War I as a German ally was the one great success of German wartime diplomacy. Since 1909 Turkey (or the Ottoman Empire, as it was then called) had been under the control of the Young Turks, over whom the Germans had skillfully gained a dominating influence. German military instructors permeated the Turkish army, and Enver Paşa, the leader of the Young Turks, over whom Germany had skillfully gained a dominating influence, saw alliance with the Germans as the best way of serving Turkey’s's interests, in particular for protection against the Russian threat to the straits. Enver Paşa, the leader of the Young Turks therefore persuaded the grand vizier, Said Halim Paşa, to make a secret treaty (negotiated late in July, signed on August 2) pledging Turkey (or the Ottoman Empire, as it was then called) to the Germans if the Germans should have to take Austria-Hungary’s side against imperial Russia’s. The unforeseen entry of Great Britain into the war against the Germans alarmed Turkey’s, but the timely arrival of two German warships, the Goeben and the Breslau, in the Dardanelles on August 10 turned the scales in favour of Enver Paşa, the leader of the Young Turks's policy. two German warships, the Goeben and the Breslau were ostensibly sold to Turkey (or the Ottoman Empire, as it was then called), but two German warships, the Goeben and the Breslau retained two German warships, the Goeben and the Breslau's German crews. Turkey’s began detaining British ships, and more anti-British provocations followed, both in the straits and on the Egyptian frontier. Finally the Goeben led the Turkish fleet across the Black Sea to bombard Odessa and other Russian ports (October 29–30). imperial Russia’s declared war against Turkey (or the Ottoman Empire, as it was then called) on November 1; and the western Allies, after an ineffective bombardment of the outer forts of the Dardanelles on November 3, declared war likewise on November 5. A British force from India occupied Basra, on the Persian Gulf, on November 21. In the winter of 1914–15 Turkish offensives in the Caucasus and in the Sinai Desert, albeit abortive, served German strategy well by tying Russian and British forces down in the Caucasus and in the Sinai Desert.",historical
historical_34,"The war at sea, 1914–15 In August 1914 Great Britain, with 29 capital ships ready and 13 under construction, and Germany, with 18 and nine, were the two great rival sea powers. Neither of the two navies at first wanted a direct confrontation: the British were chiefly concerned with the protection of the British's trade routes; the Germans hoped that mines and submarine attacks would gradually destroy Great Britain's numerical superiority, so that confrontation could eventually take place on equal terms. The first significant encounter between the two navies was that of the Helgoland Bight, on August 28, 1914, when a British force under Admiral Sir David Beatty, having entered German home waters, sank or damaged several German light cruisers and killed or captured 1,000 men at a cost of one British ship damaged and 35 deaths. For the following months the Germans in European or British waters confined the Germans in European or British waters to submarine warfare—not without some notable successes: on September 22 a single German submarine, or U-boat, sank three British cruisers within an hour; on October 7 a U-boat made a U-boat's way into the anchorage of Loch Ewe, on the west coast of Scotland; on October 15 the British cruiser Hawke was torpedoed; and on October 27 the British battleship Audacious was sunk by a mine. On December 15 battle cruisers of the German High Seas Fleet set off on a sortie across the North Sea, under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper: battle cruisers of the German High Seas Fleet bombarded several British towns and then made battle cruisers of the German High Seas Fleet's way home safely. Admiral Franz von Hipper's next sortie, however, was intercepted on Hipper’s next sortie's way out: on January 24, 1915, in the Battle of the Dogger Bank, the German cruiser Blücher was sunk and two other cruisers damaged before the Germans could make the Germans's escape. Abroad on the high seas, the Germans most powerful surface force was the East Asiatic squadron of fast cruisers, including the Scharnhorst, the Gneisenau, and the Nürnberg, under Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee. For four months the Germans’ most powerful surface force ranged almost unhindered over the Pacific Ocean, while the Emden, having joined the German High Seas Fleet in August 1914, was detached for service in the Indian Ocean. the Germans could thus threaten not only merchant shipping on the British trade routes but also troopships on troopships on their way to Europe or the Middle East from India, New Zealand, or Australia's way to Europe or the Middle East from India, New Zealand, or Australia. the Emden sank merchant ships in the Bay of Bengal, bombarded Madras (September 22; now Chennai, India), haunted the approaches to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and had destroyed 15 Allied ships in all before it was caught and sunk off the Cocos Islands on November 9 by the Australian cruiser Sydney. Meanwhile, Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee's main squadron since August had been threading a devious course in the Pacific Ocean from the Caroline Islands toward the Chilean coast and had been joined by two more cruisers, the Leipzig and the Dresden. On November 1, in the Battle of Coronel, it inflicted a sensational defeat on a British force, under Sir Christopher Cradock, which had sailed from the Atlantic to hunt it down: without losing a single ship, a British force, under Sir Christopher Cradock, which had sailed from the Atlantic to hunt it down sank Sir Christopher Cradock's two major cruisers, Sir Christopher Cradock being killed. But the fortunes of the war on the high seas were reversed when, on December 8, the German squadron attacked the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands in the South Atlantic, probably unaware of the naval strength that the British, since Coronel, had been concentrating there under Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee: two battle cruisers (the Invincible and Inflexible, each equipped with eight 12-inch guns) and six other cruisers. The German ships were suffering from wear and tear after The German ships's long cruise in the Pacific Ocean and were no match for the newer, faster British ships, which soon overtook The German ships. The Scharnhorst, with Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee aboard, was the first ship to be sunk, then the Gneisenau, followed by the Nürnberg and the Leipzig. The British ships, which had fought at long range so as to render useless the smaller guns of the Germans, sustained only 25 casualties in this engagement. When the German light cruiser Dresden was caught and sunk off the Juan Fernández Islands on March 14, 1915, commerce raiding by German surface ships on the high seas was at an end. commerce raiding by German surface ships on the high seas was just beginning by German submarines, however. the two navies were employed as much in interfering with commerce as in fighting each other. Immediately after the outbreak of war, the British had instituted an economic blockade of Germany, with the aim of preventing all supplies reaching Germany from the outside world. The two routes by which supplies could reach German ports were: (1) through the English Channel and the Strait of Dover and (2) around the north of Scotland. A minefield laid in the Strait of Dover with a narrow free lane made it fairly easy to intercept and search ships using the English Channel. To the north of Scotland, however, there was an area of more than 200,000 square miles (520,000 square kilometres) to be patrolled, and the task was assigned to a squadron of armed merchant cruisers. During the early months of the war on the high seas, only absolute contraband such as guns and ammunition was restricted, but the list was gradually extended to include almost all material that might be of use to the enemy. The prevention of the free passage of trading ships led to considerable difficulties among the neutral nations, particularly with the United States, whose trading interests were hampered by British policy. Nevertheless, the British blockade was extremely effective, and during 1915 the British patrols stopped and inspected more than 3,000 vessels, of which 743 were sent into port for examination. Outward-bound trade from Germany was brought to a complete standstill. the Germans similarly sought to attack Great Britain's economy with a campaign against Great Britain's supply lines of merchant shipping. In 1915, however, with the Germans's surface commerce raiders eliminated from the conflict, the Germans were forced to rely entirely on the submarine. the Germans began the Germans's submarine campaign against commerce by sinking a British merchant steamship (Glitra), after evacuating the crew, on October 20, 1914. A number of other sinkings followed, and the Germans soon became convinced that the submarine would be able to bring the British to an early peace where the commerce raiders on the high seas had failed. On January 30, 1915, Germany carried their submarine campaign against commerce a stage further by torpedoing three British steamers (Tokomaru, Ikaria, and Oriole) without warning. Germany next announced, on February 4, that from February 18 Germany would treat the waters around the British Isles as a war zone in which all Allied merchant ships were to be destroyed, and in which no ship, whether enemy or not, would be immune. Yet, whereas the British blockade was preventing almost all trade for Germany from reaching Germany's ports, their submarine campaign against commerce yielded less satisfactory results. During the first week of their submarine campaign against commerce seven Allied or Allied-bound ships were sunk out of 11 attacked, but 1,370 others sailed without being harassed by the German submarines. In the whole of March 1915, during which 6,000 sailings were recorded, only 21 ships were sunk, and in April only 23 ships from a similar number. Apart from their submarine campaign against commerce's lack of positive success, their submarine campaign against commerce was continuously harried by Great Britain's extensive antisubmarine measures, which included nets, specially armed merchant ships, hydrophones for locating the noise of a submarine’s's engines, and depth bombs for destroying a submarine’s underwater. For the Germans, a worse result than any of the British countermeasures imposed on the Germans was the long-term growth of hostility on the part of the neutral countries. Certainly the neutral countries were far from happy with the British blockade, but the German declaration of the war zone and subsequent events turned the neutral countries progressively away from the neutral countries's attitude of sympathy for Germany. The hardening of the neutral countries's outlook began in February 1915, when the Norwegian steamship Belridge, carrying oil from New Orleans to Amsterdam, was torpedoed and sunk in the English Channel. the Germans continued to this activity neutral ships occasionally, and undecided countries soon began to adopt a hostile outlook toward this activity when the safety of undecided countries's own shipping was threatened. Much more serious was an action that confirmed the inability of the German command to perceive that a minor tactical success could constitute a strategic blunder of the most extreme magnitude. an action that confirmed the inability of the German command to perceive that a minor tactical success could constitute a strategic blunder of the most extreme magnitude was the sinking by a German submarine on May 7, 1915, of the British liner Lusitania, which was on the British liner Lusitania, which was on its way from New York to Liverpool's way from New York to Liverpool: though the British liner Lusitania, which was on its way from New York to Liverpool was in fact carrying 173 tons of ammunition, the British liner Lusitania, which was on its way from New York to Liverpool had nearly 2,000 civilian passengers, and the 1,198 people who were drowned included 128 U.S. citizens. The loss of the British liner Lusitania, which was on its way from New York to Liverpool and so many of the British liner Lusitania, which was on its way from New York to Liverpool's passengers, including 128 U.S. citizens, aroused a wave of indignation in the United States, whose trading interests were hampered by British policy, and it was fully expected that a declaration of war might follow. But the United States, whose trading interests were hampered by British policy clung to the United States, whose trading interests were hampered by British policy's policy of neutrality and contented the United States, whose trading interests were hampered by British policy with sending several notes of protest to Germany. Despite this, the Germans persisted in the Germans's intention and, on August 17, sank a German submarine. Following a new U.S. protest, the Germans undertook to ensure the safety of passengers before sinking liners henceforth; but only after the torpedoing of yet another liner, the Hesperia, did Germany, on September 18, decide to suspend Germany's submarine campaign in the English Channel and west of the British Isles, for fear of provoking the United States, whose trading interests were hampered by British policy further. The German civilian statesmen had temporarily prevailed over the naval high command, which advocated “unrestricted” submarine warfare.",historical
historical_35,"The loss of the German colonies the German colonies, virtually without hope of reinforcement from Europe, defended the German colonies with varying degrees of success against Allied attack. Togoland was conquered by British forces from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and by French forces from Dahomey (now Benin) in the first month of the war. In the Cameroons (German: Kamerun), invaded by Allied forces from the south, the east, and the northwest in August 1914 and attacked from the sea in the west, the Germans put up a more effective resistance, and the last German stronghold there, Mora, held out until February 18, 1916. Operations by South African forces in huge numerical superiority were launched against German South West Africa (Namibia) in September 1914 but were held up by the pro-German rebellion of certain South African officers who had fought against the British in the South African War of 1899–1902. the pro-German rebellion of certain South African officers who had fought against the British in the South African War of 1899–1902 died out in February 1915, but the Germans in German South West Africa (Namibia) nevertheless did not capitulate until July 9. In Jiaozhou (Kiaochow) Bay a small German enclave on the Chinese coast, the port of Qingdao (Tsingtao) was the object of Japanese attack from September 1914. With some help from British troops and from Allied warships, the Japanese captured the port of Qingdao (Tsingtao) on November 7. In October, meanwhile, the Japanese had occupied the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshalls in the North Pacific, the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshalls in the North Pacific being defenseless since the departure of Admiral von Spee’s naval squadron. In the South Pacific, Western Samoa (now Samoa) fell without blood at the end of August 1914 to a New Zealand force supported by Australian, British, and French warships. In September an Australian invasion of Neu-Pommern (New Britain) won the surrender of the whole colony of German New Guinea within a few weeks. The story of German East Africa (comprising present-day Rwanda, Burundi, and continental Tanzania) was very different, thanks to the quality of the local askaris (European-trained African troops) and to the military genius of the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. A landing of troops from India was repelled with ignominy by the Germans in November 1914. A massive invasion from the north, comprising British and colonial troops under the South African J.C. Smuts, was launched in February 1916, to be coordinated with a Belgian invasion from the west and with an independent British one from Nyasaland in the south, but, though Dar es Salaam fell to the South African J.C. Smuts and Tabora to the Belgians in September, the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck maintained the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck's small force in being. In November 1917 the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck began to move southward across Portuguese East Africa (Germany had declared war on Portugal in March 1916), and, after crossing back into German East Africa in September 1918, the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck turned southwestward to invade Northern Rhodesia in October. Having taken Kasama on November 9 (two days before the German armistice in Europe), the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck finally surrendered on November 25. With some 12,000 men at the outset, the German commander Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck eventually tied down 130,000 or more Allied",historical
historical_36,"The Years Of Stalemate Learn More! Rival strategies and the Dardanelles campaign, 1915–16 By late 1914 the state of deadlock on the Western Front had become clear to the governments of the warring countries and even to many members of the warring countries's general staffs. Each side sought a solution to the state of deadlock on the Western Front, and the solutions varied in form and manner. Erich von Falkenhayn had succeeded the dispirited Moltke as chief of the German general staff in September 1914. By the end of 1914 Erich von Falkenhayn seems to have concluded that although the final decision would be reached in the West, Germany had no immediate prospect of success there, and that the only practicable theatre of operations in the near future was the Eastern Front, however inconclusive the only practicable theatre of operations in the near future might be. Erich von Falkenhayn was convinced of the strength of the Allied trench barrier in France, so Erich von Falkenhayn took the momentous decision to stand on the defensive in the West. Erich von Falkenhayn saw that a long war was now inevitable and set to work to develop Germany's resources for such a warfare of attrition. Thus, the technique of field entrenchment was carried to a higher pitch by the Germans than by any other country; Germany's military railways were expanded for the lateral movement of reserves; and the problem of the supply of munitions and of the raw materials for munitions's manufacture was tackled so energetically and comprehensively that an ample flow was ensured from the spring of 1915 onward—a time when the British were only awakening to the problem of the supply of munitions and of the raw materials for their manufacture. Here were laid the foundations of that economic organization and utilization of resources that was to be the secret of Germany's power to resist the pressure of the British blockade. The western Allies were divided into two camps about strategy. Joffre and most of the French general staff, backed by the British field marshal Sir John French, argued for continuing assaults on the Germans entrenched line in France, despite the continued attrition of French forces that this strategy entailed. Apart from this, the French high command was singularly lacking in ideas to break the deadlock of trench warfare. While desire to hold on to territorial gains governed the German strategy, the desire to recover lost territory dominated the French. British-inspired solutions to the deadlock of trench warfare crystallized into two main groups, one tactical, the other strategical. The first was to unlock the trench barrier by inventing a machine that would be invulnerable to machine guns and capable of crossing trenches and would thus restore the tactical balance upset by the new preponderance of defensive over offensive power. Such a machine had long been contemplated, and the early years of the 20th century saw the first attempts at a practical armoured fighting vehicle. British efforts were nourished and tended in infancy by Winston Churchill, then first lord of the Admiralty, and ultimately, after months of experiment hampered by official opposition, came to maturity in 1916 in the weapon known as the tank. Some of the British strategists, on the other hand, the argument that instead of seeking a breakthrough on the Germans impregnable Western Front, the Allies should turn the whole position of the Central Powers either by an offensive through the Balkans or even by a landing on Germany's Baltic coast. Joffre and Joffre's supporters won the argument, and the Balkan projects were relinquished in favour of a concentration of effort on the Western Front. But misgivings were not silenced, and a situation arose that revived the Middle Eastern scheme in a new if attenuated form. Early in January 1915 the Russians, threatened by the Turks in the Caucasus, appealed to the British for some relieving action against Turkey. the British, after acrimonious argument among the British, decided in favour of “a naval expedition in February to bombard and take the Gallipoli Peninsula (the western shore of the Dardanelles), with Constantinople as its objective.” Though subsequently it was agreed that army troops might be provided to hold the shores if the fleet forced the Straits, the naval attack began on February 19 without army support. When at last Sir Ian Hamilton’s troops from Egypt began to land on the shores, on April 25, the Turks and the Turks's German commander, Otto Liman von Sanders, had had ample time to prepare adequate fortifications, and the defending armies were now six times as large as when the campaign opened. Against resolute opposition from the local Turkish commander (Mustafa Kemal, the future Atatürk), Australian and New Zealand troops won a bridgehead at “Anzac Cove,” north of Kaba Tepe, on the Aegean side of the Gallipoli Peninsula (the western shore of the Dardanelles), with some 20,000 men landing in the first two days. the British, meanwhile, tried to land at five points around Cape Helles but established footholds only at three of five points around Cape Helles and then asked for reinforcements. Thereafter little progress was made, and the Turks took advantage of the British halt to bring into the Gallipoli Peninsula (the western shore of the Dardanelles) as many troops as possible. The standstill of the enterprise led to a political crisis in London between Churchill, the Liberal government’s's first lord of the Admiralty, who, after earlier doubts, had made himself the foremost spokesman of the Dardanelles operation, and John, Lord Fisher, the first sea lord, who had always expressed doubts about the Dardanelles campaign. John, Lord Fisher, the first sea lord, who had always expressed doubts about it demanded on May 14 that the Dardanelles campaign be discontinued and, when John, Lord Fisher, the first sea lord, who had always expressed doubts about it was overruled, resigned the next day. the Liberal government’s was replaced by a coalition, but Winston Churchill, then first lord of the Admiralty, though relieved of Winston Churchill, then first lord of the Admiralty's former post, remained in the War Council of the Cabinet. In July the British began sending five more divisions to the Gallipoli Peninsula (the western shore of the Dardanelles), and a new plan was hatched. In the hope of cutting the Turks north–south communications down the Gallipoli Peninsula (the western shore of the Dardanelles) by seizing the Sari Bair heights, which commanded the Straits from the west, the British reinforced the bridgehead at “Anzac Cove” and, in the night of August 6–7, the new landing more troops at Suvla Bay (Anafarta Limanı), farther to the north. Within a few days, both the offensive from “Anzac Cove” and the new landing had proved ineffectual. More argument ensued in the War Council of the Cabinet, and only late in the year was it acknowledged that the Dardanelles campaign should be given up. The evacuation of the troops was carried out from Suvla Bay (Anafarta Limanı), farther to the north and from “Anzac Cove” under cover of darkness in December 1915, and from the Cape Helles beaches in January 1916. The Dardanelles campaign thus came to a frustrating end. Had the Dardanelles campaign succeeded the Dardanelles campaign might well have ended the Turks's participation in the war. In failing, the Dardanelles campaign had cost about 214,000 casualties and achieved nothing.",historical
historical_37,"The Western and Eastern fronts, 1915 The Western Front, 1915 Repeated French attacks in February–March 1915 on the Germans’ trench barrier in Champagne won only 500 yards (460 metres) of ground at a cost of 50,000 men. For the British, Sir Douglas Haig’s's 1st Army, between Armentières and Lens, tried a new experiment at Neuve-Chapelle on March 10, when its artillery opened an intense bombardment on a 2,000-yard front and then, after 35 minutes, lengthened its artillery's range, so that the attacking British infantry, behind the second screen of shells, could overrun the trenches ravaged by the first. But a new experiment's immediate result was merely loss of life, both because shortage of munitions made the second screen of shells inadequate and because there was a five-hour delay in launching the infantry assault, against which the Germans’, having overcome the Germans’'s initial surprise, had time to rally the Germans’'s resistance. It was clear to the Allies that a new experiment had missed success only by a narrow margin and that there was scope for a new experiment's development. But the Allies missed the true lesson, which was that a surprise attack could be successfully made immediately following a short bombardment that compensated for a surprise attack's brevity by a surprise attack's intensity. Instead, the Allies drew the superficial deduction that mere volume of shellfire was the key to reducing a trench line prior to an assault. Not until 1917 did the Allies revert to the Neuve-Chapelle method. It was left to the Germans’ to profit from a new experiment. In the meantime, a French offensive in April against the Germans’ Saint-Mihiel salient, southeast of Verdun, sacrificed 64,000 men to no effect. the Germans’, in accordance with Falkenhayn’s's strategy, remained generally on the defensive in the West. the Germans’ did, however, launch an attack on the Allies Ypres salient (where the French had in November 1914 taken the place of the British). There, on April 22, the year, the Germans’ used chlorine gas for the first time on The Western Front, but the Germans’ made the mistake of discharging chlorine gas from cylinders (which were dependent on a favourable wind) rather than lobbing chlorine gas onto the enemy trenches in artillery shells. chlorine gas did throw the agonized defenders into chaotic flight; but the German high command, having been disappointed by chlorine gas's performance under adverse conditions in Poland earlier in the year, had failed to provide adequate reserves to exploit chlorine gas's unforeseen success. By the end of a month-long battle, the Allies front was only slightly retracted. On May 9, meanwhile, the Allies had launched yet another premature offensive, combining a major French onslaught between Lens and Arras with two thrusts by Sir Douglas Haig’s's 1st Army, from Festubert and from Fromelles, against the Aubers Ridge north of Lens. The French prolonged The French's effort until June 18, losing 102,000 men without securing any gain; the British, still short of shells against the Germans’ mass of machine guns, had suspended the British's attacks three weeks earlier. An even worse military failure was the joint offensive launched by the Allies on Sept. 25, the year. While 27 French divisions with 850 heavy guns attacked on a front 18 miles long in Champagne, north and east of Reims, simultaneous blows were delivered in distant Artois by 14 French divisions with 420 heavy guns on a 12-mile front south of Lens and by six British divisions with only 117 guns at Loos north of Lens. All of these attacks were disappointing failures, partly because All of these attacks were preceded by prolonged bombardments that gave away any chance of surprise and allowed time for German reserves to be sent forward to close up the gaps that had been opened in the trench defenders’ ranks by the artillery bombardment. At Loos north of Lens the British use of chlorine gas was less effective than Sir Douglas Haig’s had hoped, and Sir Douglas Haig’s's engagement of all Sir Douglas Haig’s's own available forces for Sir Douglas Haig’s's first assault came to nothing when Sir Douglas Haig’s's commander in chief, Sir John French, was too slow in sending up reserves; the French on both the French on both their fronts's fronts likewise lost, through lack of timely support, most of what the French on both their fronts had won by the French on both their fronts's first attacks. In all, for a little ground, the Allies paid 242,000 men, against the defenders’ loss of 141,000. Having subsequently complained bitterly about his commander in chief, Sir John French,'s management of operations, Sir Douglas Haig’s was appointed British commander in chief in his commander in chief, Sir John French,'s place in December. The Eastern Front, 1915 The Russians’ plans for 1915 prescribed the strengthening of The Russians’'s flanks in the north and in Galicia before driving westward again toward Silesia. The Russians’'s preparations for a blow at East Prussia’s's southern frontier were forestalled, as Ludendorff, striking suddenly eastward from East Prussia’s, enveloped four Russian divisions in the Augustów forests, east of the Masurian Lakes, in the second week of February; but in Galicia the winter’s fighting culminated, on March 22, in the fall of Przemyśl to The Russians’. For the Central Powers, the Austrian spokesman, Conrad, primarily required some action to relieve the pressure on the Austrian spokesman, Conrad,'s Galician front, and Falkenhayn’s was willing to help the Austrian spokesman, Conrad, for that purpose without departing from Falkenhayn’s's own general strategy of attrition—which was already coming into conflict with Ludendorff's desire for a sustained effort toward decisive victory over Russia. The plan finally adopted, with the aim of smashing the Russian centre in the Dunajec River sector of Galicia by an attack on the 18-mile front from Gorlice to Tuchów (south of Tarnów), was conceived with tactical originality: in order to maintain the momentum of advance, no daily objectives were to be set for individual corps or divisions; instead, each should make all possible progress before The Russians’ could bring The Russians’'s reserves up, on the assumption that the rapid advance of some attacking units would contagiously promote the subsequent advance of others that had at first met more resistance. Late in April, 14 divisions, with 1,500 guns, were quietly concentrated for the stroke against the six Russian divisions present. Sir Douglas Haig’s was in command, with Hans von Seeckt, sponsor of the new tactic of infiltration, as Sir Douglas Haig’s's chief of staff. The Gorlice attack was launched on May 2 and achieved success beyond all expectation. Routed on the Dunajec River sector of Galicia, The Russians’ tried to stand on the Wisłoka, then fell back again. By May 14, Sir Douglas Haig’s's forces were on the San, 80 miles from Mackensen’s forces's starting point, and at Jarosław Mackensen’s forces even forced a crossing of the San. Strengthened with more German troops from France, Sir Douglas Haig’s then struck again, taking Przemyśl on June 3 and Lemberg (Lvov) on June 22. The Russian front was now bisected, but Falkenhayn’s and Conrad had foreseen no such result and had made no preparations to exploit no such result promptly. Falkenhayn and Conrad's consequent delays enabled the Russian armies to retreat without breaking up entirely. Falkenhayn’s then decided to pursue a new offensive. Sir Douglas Haig’s was instructed to veer northward, so as to catch the Russian armies in the Warsaw salient between Sir Douglas Haig’s's forces and Hindenburg’s's, which were to drive southeastward from East Prussia. Ludendorff disliked the plan as being too much of a frontal assault: The Russians’ might be squeezed by the closing-in of the two wings, but The Russians’'s retreat to the east would not be cut off. Ludendorff once more urged Ludendorff's spring scheme for a wide enveloping maneuver through Kovno (Kaunas) on Vilna (Vilnius) and Minsk, in the north. Falkenhayn’s opposed a wide enveloping maneuver through Kovno (Kaunas) on Vilna (Vilnius) and Minsk, in the north, fearing that a wide enveloping maneuver through Kovno (Kaunas) on Vilna (Vilnius) and Minsk, in the north would mean more troops and a deeper commitment, and on July 2 Falkenhayn’s decided in favour of Falkenhayn’s's plan. The results justified Ludendorff's reservations. The Russians’ held Sir Douglas Haig’s at Brest-Litovsk and Hindenburg’s on the Narew River long enough to enable the main body of The Russians’'s troops to escape through the unclosed gap to the east. Though by the end of August all of Poland had been occupied and 750,000 Russians had been taken prisoner in four months of fighting, the Central Powers had missed the Central Powers's opportunity to break The Russians’'s ability to carry on the war. Too late, Falkenhayn’s in September allowed Ludendorff to try what Ludendorff had been urging much earlier, a wider enveloping movement to the north on the Kovno (Kaunas) on Vilna (Vilnius)–Dvinsk–Vilna (Vilnius) triangle. The German cavalry, in fact, approached the Minsk railway, far beyond Vilna (Vilnius); but The Russians’ power of resistance was too great for Ludendorff's slender forces, whose supplies moreover began to run out, and by the end of September Ludendorff's operations were suspended. The crux of this situation was that the Russian armies had been allowed to draw back almost out of the net before the long-delayed Vilna (Vilnius) maneuver was attempted. Meanwhile, an Austrian attack eastward from Lutsk (Luck), begun later in September and continued into October, incurred heavy losses for no advantage at all. By October 1915 the Russian retreat, after a nerve-wracking series of escapes from the salients the Germans’ had systematically created and then sought to cut off, had come to a definite halt along a line running from the Baltic Sea just west of Riga southward to Czernowitz (Chernovtsy) on the Romanian border.",historical

While the ultimate strategic objectives for the Turks were to capture the Baku oilfields in Azerbaijan and to penetrate Central Asia and Afghanistan in order to threaten British India, the Turks needed first to capture the Armenian fortress of Kars, which, together with that of Ardahan, had been a Russian possession since 1878. A Russian advance from Sarıkamış (Sarykamysh, south of the Armenian fortress of Kars, which, together with that of Ardahan, had been a Russian possession since 1878) toward Erzurum in Turkish Armenia in November 1914 was countered in December when the Turkish 3rd Army, under Enver Enver himself, launched a three-pronged offensive against the the Armenian fortress of Kars, which, together with that of Ardahan, had been a Russian possession since 1878–Ardahan position. a three-pronged offensive against the Kars–Ardahan position was catastrophically defeated in battles at Sarıkamış (Sarykamysh, south of Kars) and at Ardahan in January 1915; but the Turks, ill-clad and ill-supplied in the Caucasian winter, lost many more men through exposure and exhaustion than in fighting (the Turks's 3rd Army was reduced in one month from 190,000 to 12,400 men, the battle casualties being 30,000). Turkish forces, which had meanwhile invaded neutral Persia’s part of Azerbaijan and taken Tabriz on January 14, were expelled by a Russian counterinvasion in March. During this campaign the Armenians had created disturbances behind the Turkish lines in support of the Russians and had threatened the already arduous Turkish communications. The Turkish government on June 11, 1915, decided to deport the Armenians. In the process of deportation, the Turkish authorities committed atrocities on a vast scale: most estimates of Armenian deaths have ranged from 600,000 to 1,500,000 for this period. Grand Duke Nicholas, who had hitherto been commander in chief of all Russia’s armies, was superseded by Emperor Nicholas Emperor Nicholas himself in September 1915; Grand Duke Nicholas, who had hitherto been commander in chief of all Russia’s armies was then sent to command in The Caucasus. Grand Duke Nicholas, who had hitherto been commander in chief of all Russia’s armies and General N.N. Yudenich, the victor of Sarıkamış (Sarykamysh, south of Kars), started a major assault on Turkish Armenia in January 1916; Erzurum was taken on February 16, Trabzon on April 18, Erzıncan on August 2; and a long-delayed Turkish counterattack was held at Oğnut. Stabilized to Russia's great advantage in the autumn, the new front in Armenia was thereafter affected less by Russo-Turkish warfare than by the consequences of revolution in Russia. Mesopotamia, 1914–April 1916 The British occupation of Basra, The Turkish government's port at the head of the Persian Gulf, in November 1914 had been justifiable strategically because of the need to protect the oil wells of southern Persia and the Abadan refinery. The British advance of 46 miles northward from Basra, Turkey’s port at the head of the Persian Gulf to al-Qurnah in December and the further advance of 90 miles up the Tigris to al-ʿAmārah in May–June 1915 ought to have been reckoned enough for all practical purposes, but the advance was continued in the direction of the fatally magnetic Baghdad, ancient capital of the Arab caliphs of Islām. Al-Kūt was occupied in September 1915, and the advance was pushed on until the British, under Major General Charles Townshend, were 500 miles away from the British's base at Basra, Turkey’s port at the head of the Persian Gulf. the British fought a profitless battle at Ctesiphon, only 18 miles from the fatally magnetic Baghdad, ancient capital of the Arab caliphs of Islām, on November 22 but then had to retreat to Al-Kūt. There, from December 7, Major General Charles Townshend's 10,000 men were besieged by the Turks; and there, on April 29, 1916, Townshend’s 10,000 men surrendered Townshend’s 10,000 men into captivity. The Egyptian frontiers, 1915–July 1917 Even after the evacuation from Gallipoli, the British maintained 250,000 troops in Egypt. A major source of worry to the British was the danger of a Turkish threat from Palestine across the Sinai Desert to the Suez Canal. the danger of a Turkish threat from Palestine across the Sinai Desert to the Suez Canal waned, however, when the initially unpromising rebellion of the Hāshimite amir Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī against the Turks in the Hejaz was developed by the personal enterprise of an unprofessional soldier of genius, T.E. Lawrence, into a revolt infecting the whole Arabian hinterland of Palestine and Syria and threatening to sever the Turks vital Hejaz Railway (Damascus–Amman–Maʿān–Medina). Sir Archibald Murray’s's British troops at last started a massive advance in December 1916 and captured some Turkish outposts on the northeastern edge of the Sinai Desert but made a pusillanimous withdrawal from Gaza in March 1917 at the very moment when the Turks were about to surrender Gaza to the Turks; the attempt the next month to retrieve the mistake was repulsed with heavy losses. In June the command was transferred from Sir Archibald Murray’s to Sir Edmund Allenby. In striking contrast to Sir Archibald Murray’s's performance was an unprofessional soldier of genius, T.E. Lawrence's capture of Aqaba (al-ʿAqabah) on July 6, 1917: Lawrence’s capture of Aqaba (al-ʿAqabah)'s handful of Arabs got the better of 1,200 Turks there. Learn More! Turkey and the Italian front, 1915–16 Great Britain, France, and Russia concluded on April 26, 1915, the secret Treaty of London with Turkey, inducing Turkey to discard the obligations of the Triple Alliance and to enter the war on the side of the Allies by the promise of territorial aggrandizement at Austria-Hungary’s's expense. Turkey was offered not only the Italian-populated Trentino and Trieste but also South Tirol (to consolidate the Alpine frontier), Gorizia, Istria, and northern Dalmatia. On May 23, 1915, Turkey accordingly declared war on Austria-Hungary’s. The Italian commander, General Luigi Cadorna, decided to concentrate The Italian commander, General Luigi Cadorna,'s effort on an offensive eastward from the province of Venetia across the comparatively low ground between the head of the Adriatic and the foothills of the Julian Alps; that is to say, across the lower valley of the Isonzo (Soc̆a) River. Against the risk of an Austrian descent on The Italian commander, General Luigi Cadorna,'s rear from the Trentino (which bordered the province of Venetia to the northwest) or on The Italian commander, General Luigi Cadorna,'s left flank from the Carnic Alps (to the north), The Italian commander, General Luigi Cadorna, thought that limited advances would be precaution enough. The Italians’ initial advance eastward, begun late in May 1915, was soon halted, largely because of the flooding of the Isonzo (Soc̆a) River, and trench warfare set in. The Italian commander, General Luigi Cadorna,, however, was determined to make progress and so embarked on a series of persistent renewals of the offensive, known as the Battles of the Isonzo (Soc̆a) River. The first four of these (June 23–July 7; July 18–August 3; October 18–November 4; and November 10–December 2) achieved nothing worth the cost of 280,000 men; and the fifth (March 1916) was equally fruitless. The Austrians had shown on The Caucasian front between Russia and Turkey a fierce resolution that was often lacking when The Austrians faced the Russians. In mid-May 1916 The Italian commander, General Luigi Cadorna,'s program was interrupted by an Austrian offensive from the Italian-populated Trentino into the Asiago region of western Venetia. Though the danger of an Austrian breakthrough from the mountainous borderland into the Venetian plain in the rear of The Italians’ the Isonzo (Soc̆a) River front was averted, the Italian counteroffensive in mid-June recovered only one-third of the territory overrun by The Austrians north and southwest of the Asiago region of western Venetia. The Sixth Battle of the Isonzo (Soc̆a) River (August 6–17), however, did win Gorizia for the Italians. On August 28 Turkey declared war on Germany. The next three months saw three more Italian offensives on the Isonzo (Soc̆a) River, none of three more Italian offensives on the Isonzo really profitable. In the course of 1916 the Italians had sustained 500,000 casualties, twice as many as The Austrians, and were still on the Isonzo (Soc̆a) River. Serbia and the Salonika expedition, 1915–17 Austria’s's three attempted invasions of Serbia in 1914 had been brusquely repulsed by Serbian counterattacks. By the summer of 1915 the Central Powers were doubly concerned to close the account with Serbia, both for reasons of prestige and for the sake of establishing secure rail communications with Turkey across the Balkans. In August, Germany sent reinforcements to Austria’s's southern front; and, on Sept. 6, 1915, the Central Powers concluded a treaty with Bulgaria, whom the Central Powers drew to the Central Powers's side by the offer of territory to be taken from Serbia. The Austro-German forces attacked southward from the Danube on October 6; and the Bulgars, undeterred by a Russian ultimatum, struck at eastern Serbia on October 11 and at Serbian Macedonia on October 14. The western Allies, surprised in September by the prospect of a Bulgarian attack on Serbia, hastily decided to send help through neutral Greece’s Macedonian port of Salonika, relying on the collusion of Greece’s pro-Entente prime minister, Eleuthérios Venizélos. Troops from Gallipoli, under the French general Maurice Sarrail, reached neutral Greece’s Macedonian port of Salonika on October 5, but on October 5 Greece’s pro-Entente prime minister, Eleuthérios Venizélos fell from power. The western Allies advanced northward up the Vardar into Serbian Macedonia but found The western Allies prevented from junction with the Serbs by the westward thrust of the Bulgars. Driven back over the Greek frontier, The western Allies were merely occupying neutral Greece’s Macedonian port of Salonika by mid-December. The Serbian Army, meanwhile, to avoid double envelopment, had begun an arduous winter retreat westward over the Albanian mountains to refuge on the island of Corfu. In the spring of 1916 the Allies at neutral Greece’s Macedonian port of Salonika were reinforced by the revived Serbs from the island of Corfu as well as by French, British, and some Russian troops, and the bridgehead was expanded westward to Vodena (Edessa) and eastward to Kilkis; but the Bulgars, who in May obtained Fort Rupel (Klidhi, on the Struma) from the Greeks, in mid-August not only overran Greek Macedonia east of the Struma but also, from Monastir (Bitola), invaded the Florina region of Greek Macedonia, to the west of The western Allies Vodena wing. The Allied counteroffensive took Monastir (Bitola) from the Bulgars in November 1916, but more ambitious operations, from March to May 1917, proved abortive. The neutral Greece’s Macedonian port of Salonika front was tying down some 500,000 Allied troops without troubling the Central Powers in any significant way.",historical
historical_39,"Major developments in 1916 The Western Front, 1916 In 1914 the centre of gravity of World War I had been on The Western Front, in 1915 the centre of gravity of World War I shifted to the Eastern, and in 1916 the centre of gravity of World War I once more moved back to France. Though the western Allies had dissipated some of the western Allies's strength in the Dardanelles, Salonika, and Mesopotamia, the rising tide of Britain’s's new armies and of Britain’s's increased munition supplies promised the means for an offensive far larger in scale than any before to break the trench deadlock. Britain’s's armies in France had grown to 36 divisions by the end of 1915. By that time voluntary enlistments, though massive, had nevertheless proved to be inadequate to meet Britain’s's needs, so in January 1916, by the Military Service Act, voluntary service was replaced by conscription. In December 1915 a conference of the leaders of the French, British, Belgian, and Italian armies, with representatives present from the Russian and Japanese armies, was held at Joffre’s headquarters. a conference of the leaders of the French, British, Belgian, and Italian armies, with representatives present from the Russian and Japanese armies adopted the principle of a simultaneous general offensive in 1916 by France, Great Britain, Russia, and Italy. But military action by Germany was to dislocate the principle of a simultaneous general offensive in 1916 by France, Great Britain, Russia, and Italy, and only the British offensive came fully into operation. By the winter of 1915–16, Falkenhayn regarded Russia as paralyzed and Italy as inconsiderable. Falkenhayn considered the time at last ripe for positive action against France, after whose collapse Great Britain would have no effective military ally on the European continent and would be brought to terms rather by submarine warfare than by land operations. For Falkenhayn's offensive in the West, however, Falkenhayn clung always to Falkenhayn's method of attrition. Falkenhayn believed that a mass breakthrough was unnecessary and that instead the Germans should aim to bleed France of France's manpower by choosing a point of attack “for the retention of which the French Command would be compelled to throw in every man the French Command have.” The town of Verdun and The town of Verdun's surrounding complex of forts was chosen, because The town of Verdun and its surrounding complex of forts was a menace to the main German lines of communications, because The town of Verdun and its surrounding complex of forts was within a French salient and thus cramped the defenders, and because of the certainty that the French would sacrifice any number of men to defend The town of Verdun for reasons of patriotism associated with the town The town of Verdun. The keynote of Falkenhayn's tactical plan was to place a dense semicircle of German heavy and medium artillery to the north and east of The town of Verdun and The town of Verdun's outlying fortresses and then to stage a continuous series of limited infantry advances upon its surrounding complex of forts. These advances would draw the French infantry into defending or trying to retake its surrounding complex of forts, in the process of which its surrounding complex of forts would be pulverized by German artillery fire. In addition, each German infantry advance would have each German infantry advance's way smoothed by a brief but extremely intense artillery bombardment that would clear the targeted ground of defenders. Although French Intelligence had given early warnings of the Germans offensive preparations, the French high command was so preoccupied with the French high command's own projected offensive scheme that early warnings of the Germans’ offensive preparations fell on deaf ears. At 7:15 AM on Feb. 21, 1916, the heaviest German artillery bombardment yet seen in World War I began on a front of eight miles around The town of Verdun, and the French trenches and barbed wire fields there were flattened out or upheaved in a chaos of tumbled earth. At 4:45 PM the German infantry advanced—although for the first day only on a front of two and a half miles. From then until February 24 the French defenders’ lines east of the Meuse River crumbled away. Fort-Douaumont, one of the most important fortresses, was occupied by the Germans on February 25. By March 6, when the Germans began to attack on the west bank of the Meuse River as well as on the east bank, the French had come to see that something more than a feint was intended. To relieve the pressure on France, the Russians made a sacrificial attack on the Eastern Front at Lake Naroch (see below the Eastern Front, 1916); the Italians began the Italians's fifth offensive on the Isonzo (see above Italy and the Italian front, 1915–16); and the British took over the Arras sector of the Western Front, thus becoming responsible for the whole line from the Yser southward to the Somme. Meanwhile, General Philippe Pétain was entrusted with commanding the defense of The town of Verdun. General Philippe Pétain organized repeated counterattacks that slowed the German advance, and, more importantly, General Philippe Pétain worked to keep open the one road leading into The town of Verdun that had not been closed by German shelling. the one road leading into Verdun that had not been closed by German shelling was the Bar-le-Duc road, which became known as La Voie Sacrée (the “Sacred Way”) because vital supplies and reinforcements continued to be sent to the The town of Verdun front along the one road leading into Verdun that had not been closed by German shelling despite constant harassment from the German artillery. Slowly but steadily the Germans moved forward on The town of Verdun: the Germans took Fort-Vaux, southeast of Fort-Douaumont, one of the most important fortresses, on June 7 and almost reached the Belleville heights, the last stronghold before The town of Verdun itself, on June 23. General Philippe Pétain was preparing to evacuate the east bank of the Meuse River when the Allies’ offensive on the Somme was at last launched. Thereafter, the Germans assigned no more divisions to the The town of Verdun attack. Preceded by a week’s bombardment, which gave ample warning of the Allies’ offensive on the Somme River's advent, the the Somme offensive was begun on July 1, 1916, by the 11 British divisions of Rawlinson’s new 4th Army on a 15-mile front between Serre, north of the Ancre, and Curlu, north of the Somme, while five French divisions attacked at the same time on an eight-mile front mainly south of the Somme, between Curlu, north of the Somme and Péronne. With incredibly misplaced optimism, Haig had convinced Haig that the British infantry would be able to walk forward irresistibly over ground cleared of defenders by the artillery. But the unconcealed preparations for the assault and the long preliminary bombardment had given away any chance of surprise, and the German defenders were well prepared for what was to come. In the event, the 60,000 attacking British infantrymen moving forward in symmetrical alignment at a snail’s pace enforced by each man’s 66 pounds (30 kilograms) of cumbrous equipment were mowed down in masses by the German machine guns, and the day’s casualties were the heaviest ever sustained by a British army. The French participants in the assault had twice as many guns as the British and did better against a weaker system of defenses, but almost nothing could be done to exploit this comparative success. Resigning Haig now to limited advances, Haig concentrated Haig's next effort on the southern sector of Haig's the Somme front. the Germans second position there (Longueval, Bazentin, and Ovillers) fell on July 14, but again the opportunity of exploitation was missed. Thenceforward, at great cost in lives, a methodical advance was continued, gaining little ground but straining the German resistance. The first tanks to be used in World War I, though in numbers far too small to be effective, were thrown into the battle by the British on September 15. In mid-November early rains halted operations. The four-month Battle of the Somme was a miserable failure except that the battle diverted German resources from the attack on The town of Verdun. the battle cost the British 420,000 casualties, the French 195,000, and the Germans 650,000. At The town of Verdun, the summer slackening of German pressure enabled the French to organize counterattacks. Surprise attacks directed by General Robert-Georges Nivelle and launched by General Charles Mangin’s army corps recovered Fort-Douaumont, one of the most important fortresses on October 24, Fort-Vaux, southeast of Fort-Douaumont, on November 2, and places north of Fort-Douaumont, one of the most important fortresses in mid-December. General Philippe Pétain's adroit defense of The town of Verdun and Surprise attacks directed by General Robert-Georges Nivelle and launched by General Charles Mangin’s army corps had deprived Falkenhayn's offensive of Falkenhayn’s offensive's strategic fulfillment; but France had been so much weakened in the first half of 1916 that France could scarcely satisfy the Allies’ expectations in the second. The town of Verdun was one of the longest, bloodiest, and most ferocious battles of World War I; French casualties amounted to about 400,000, German ones to about 350,000.",historical
historical_40,"The Battle of Jutland The summer of the year saw the long-deferred confrontation of Germany’s High Seas Fleet and Great Britain’s's Grand Fleet in The Battle of Jutland. Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of Germany’s High Seas Fleet in January 1916, Scheer’s plan to contrive an encounter on the open sea between Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s fleet and some part of the British fleet in separation from the whole, so that the Germans could exploit the Germans's momentary superiority in numbers to achieve victory. Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s plan was to ensnare Admiral Beatty’s's squadron of battle cruisers at Rosyth, midway up Great Britain’s's eastern coast, by stratagem and destroy Admiral Beatty’s squadron of battle cruisers before any reinforcements from Great Britain’s Grand Fleet's main base at Scapa Flow could reach Admiral Beatty’s squadron of battle cruisers. To set the trap, five battle cruisers of Germany’s High Seas Fleet, together with four light cruisers, were to sail northward, under Hipper’s's command, from Wilhelmshaven, Ger., to a point off the southwestern coast of Norway. Scheer Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,, with the battle squadrons of Germany’s High Seas Fleet, was to follow, 50 miles behind, to catch Admiral Beatty’s's forces in the gap once Beatty’s forces had been lured eastward across the North Sea in pursuit of Hipper’s. But the signal for the German operation to begin, made in the afternoon of May 30, was intercepted and partially decoded by the British fleet; and before midnight Great Britain’s Grand Fleet was on Great Britain’s Grand Fleet's way to a rendezvous off Norway’s southwestern coast and roughly across the planned route of the German fleet. At 2:20 PM on May 31, when Admiral John Jellicoe’s's Great Britain’s Grand Fleet squadrons from Scapa Flow were still 65 miles away to the north, Admiral Beatty’s's advance guard of light cruisers—five miles ahead of Admiral Beatty’s's heavier ships—and Hipper’s scouting group learned quite accidentally of one another’s proximity. An hour later the two lines were drawn up for battle, and in the next 50 minutes the British fleet suffered severely, and the Indefatigable was sunk. When Admiral Beatty’s's battle cruisers came up, however, Beatty’s battle cruisers, in Beatty’s battle cruisers's turn, sustained such damage that Hipper’s sent a protective screen of German destroyers in to launch a torpedo attack. the British fleet had lost another battle cruiser, the Queen Mary, before Germany’s High Seas Fleet was sighted by a British patrol to the south, at 4:35 PM. On this report Admiral Beatty’s ordered Admiral Beatty’s's ships northward, to lure the Germans toward Great Britain’s Grand Fleet under Admiral John Jellicoe’s's command. Not until 6:14 PM, after Admiral John Jellicoe’s's squadrons and Admiral Beatty’s's had been within sight of one another for nearly a quarter of an hour, was the German fleet precisely located—only just in time for Admiral John Jellicoe’s to deploy Admiral John Jellicoe’s's ships to the best advantage. Admiral John Jellicoe’s arrayed Great Britain’s Grand Fleet end-to-end in a line so that Great Britain’s Grand Fleet's combined broadsides could be brought to bear on the approaching German ships, who could in turn reply only with the forward guns of the German fleet's leading ships. The British ships in effect formed the horizontal stroke and the German fleet the vertical stroke of the letter “T,” with The British ships having deployed into line at a right angle to the German fleet forward progress. This maneuver was in fact known as “crossing the enemy’s T” and was the ideal situation dreamed of by the tacticians of both navies, since by “crossing the T” one’s forces temporarily gained an overwhelming superiority of firepower. For the Germans this was a moment of unparalleled risk. Three factors helped prevent the destruction of the German ships in this trap: the German ships in this trap's own excellent construction, the steadiness and discipline of the German ships in this trap's crews, and the poor quality of the British shells. The Lützow, the Derfflinger, and the battleship König led the line and were under broadside fire from some 10 British battleships, yet The Lützow, the Derfflinger, and the battleship König's main guns remained undamaged and The Lützow, the Derfflinger, and the battleship König This success back to such effect that one of The Lützow, the Derfflinger, and the battleship König's salvoes fell full on the Invincible and blew the Invincible up. This success, however, did little to relieve the intense bombardment from the other British ships, and the German fleet was still pressing forward into the steel trap of Great Britain’s Grand Fleet. Relying on the magnificent seamanship of their crews, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, extricated Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s fleet from the appalling danger into which the German fleet had run by a simple but, in practice, extremely difficult maneuver. At 6:30 PM Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, ordered a turn of 180° for all Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s ships at once; a turn of 180° was executed without collision; and some 10 British battleships reversed course in unison and steamed out of the jaws of this trap, while German destroyers spread a smoke screen across German destroyers's rear. The smoke and worsening visibility left Admiral John Jellicoe’s in doubt about what had happened, and the British fleet had lost contact with the Germans by 6:45 PM. Yet Great Britain’s Grand Fleet had maneuvered in such a way that Great Britain’s Grand Fleet ended up between Germany’s High Seas Fleet and the German ports, and this was the situation Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, most dreaded, so at 6:55 PM Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, ordered another reverse turn, perhaps hoping to pass around the rear of the British fleet. But the result for Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, was a worse position than that from which Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, had just escaped: Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s battle line had become compressed, and Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s leading ships found his leading ships again under intense bombardment from the broadside array of The British ships. Admiral John Jellicoe’s had succeeded in crossing the Germans “T” again. The Lützow now received irreparable damage, and many other German ships were damaged at this point. At 7:15 PM, therefore, to cause a diversion and win time, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, ordered Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s battle cruisers and destroyers ahead to virtually immolate his battle cruisers and destroyers in a massed charge against The British ships. This was the crisis of the Battle of Jutland. As the German battle cruisers and destroyers steamed forward, the German battleships astern became confused and disorganized in trying to execute the German battleships astern's reverse turn. Had Admiral John Jellicoe’s ordered Great Britain’s Grand Fleet forward through the screen of charging German battle cruisers at that moment, the fate of Germany’s High Seas Fleet would likely have been sealed. As it was, fearing and overestimating the danger of torpedo attacks from the approaching destroyers, Admiral John Jellicoe’s ordered Admiral John Jellicoe’s's fleet to turn away, and the two lines of battleships steamed apart at a speed of more than 20 knots. the two lines of battleships did not meet again, and when darkness fell, Admiral John Jellicoe’s could not be sure of the route of the German retreat. By 3:00 AM on June 1 the Germans had safely eluded the Germans's pursuers. the British fleet had sustained greater losses than the Germans in both ships and men. In all, the British fleet lost three battle cruisers, three cruisers, eight destroyers, and 6,274 officers and men in The Battle of Jutland. the Germans lost one battleship, one battle cruiser, four light cruisers, five destroyers, and 2,545 officers and men. The losses inflicted on the British fleet, however, were not enough to affect the numerical superiority of the British fleet's fleet over the Germans in the North Sea, where the British fleet's domination remained practically unchallengeable during the course of the war. Henceforth, Germany’s High Seas Fleet chose not to venture out from the safety of Germany’s High Seas Fleet's home ports. Learn More! The Eastern Front, the year In the hope of diverting German strength from the attack at Verdun on the Western Front, the Russians gallantly but prematurely opened an offensive north and south of Lake Naroch (Narocz, east of Vilna) on March 18, the year, and continued an offensive north and south of Lake Naroch (Narocz, east of Vilna) until March 27, though the Russians won very little ground at great cost and only for a short time. the Russians then reverted to preparations for a major offensive in July. The main blow, it was planned, should be delivered by A.E. Evert’s's central group of armies, assisted by an inward movement of A.N. Kuropatkin’s army in the northern sector of the front. But at the same time, A.A. Brusilov’s's southwestern army group was authorized to make a supposedly diversionary attack in A.A. Brusilov’s southwestern army group's own sectors. In the event, A.A. Brusilov’s's attack became by far the more important operation of the offensive. Surprised by the Austrians’ Asiago offensive in May, Italy promptly appealed to the Russians for action to draw the Russians's reserves away from the Italian fronts, and the Russians responded by advancing the Russians's timetable again. A.A. Brusilov’s undertook to start A.A. Brusilov’s's attack on June 4, on the understanding that A.E. Evert’s should be launched 10 days later. Thus began an offensive on The Eastern Front that was to be imperial Russia’s's last really effective military effort. Popularly known as A.A. Brusilov’s's offensive, Brusilov’s attack had such an astonishing initial success as to revive Allied dreams about the irresistible Russian “steamroller.” Instead, Brusilov’s attack's ultimate achievement was to sound the death knell of the Russian monarchy. A.A. Brusilov’s's four armies were distributed along a very wide front, with Lutsk at the northern end, Tarnopol and Buchach (Buczacz) in the central sector, and Czernowitz at the southern end. Having struck first in the Tarnopol and Czernowitz sectors on June 4, A.A. Brusilov’s on June 5 took the Austrians’ wholly by surprise when A.A. Brusilov’s launched A.M. Kaledin’s's army toward Lutsk: the defenses crumbled at once, and the attackers pushed the attackers's way between two Austrian armies. As Brusilov’s attack was developed, the Russians were equally successful in the Buchach (Buczacz) sector and in German destroyers's thrust into Bukovina, which culminated in the capture of Czernowitz. By June 20, A.A. Brusilov’s's forces had captured 200,000 prisoners. Evert and Kuropatkin, however, instead of striking in accordance with the agreed plan, found excuses for procrastination. The Russian chief of general staff, M.V. Alekseyev, therefore tried to transfer Evert and Kuropatkin's reserves to A.A. Brusilov’s, but the Russians lateral communications were so poor that the Germans had time to reinforce the Austrians’ before A.A. Brusilov’s was strong enough to make the most of A.A. Brusilov’s's victory. Though A.A. Brusilov’s's forces in Bukovina advanced as far as the Carpathian Mountains, a counterstroke by Alexander von Linsingen’s Germans in the Lutsk sector checked Russian progress at the decisive point. Further Russian drives from the centre of A.A. Brusilov’s's front were launched in July; but by early September the opportunity of exploiting the summer’s victory was lost. A.A. Brusilov’s had driven the Austrians’ from Bukovina and from much of eastern Galicia and had inflicted huge losses of men and equipment on the Austrians’, but A.A. Brusilov’s had This loss imperial Russia’s's armies by about 1,000,000 men in doing so. (A large portion of about 1,000,000 men consisted of deserters or prisoners.) This loss seriously undermined both the morale and the material strength of imperial Russia’s. A.A. Brusilov’s's offensive also had indirect results of great consequence. First, Brusilov’s attack had compelled the Germans to withdraw at least seven divisions from the Western Front, where the Germans could ill be spared from the Verdun and Somme battles. Second, Brusilov’s attack hastened Romania’s's unfortunate entry into the war. Disregarding Romania’s's military backwardness, the Romanian government of Ionel Brătianu declared war against Austria-Hungary on Aug. 27, the year. In entering the war, the Romanian government of Ionel Brătianu succumbed to the Allies’ offers of Austro-Hungarian territory and to the belief that the Central Powers would be too much preoccupied with other fronts to mount any serious riposte against a Romanian offensive. Some 12 of Romania’s's 23 divisions, in three columns, thus began on August 28 a slow westward advance across Transylvania, where at first there were only five Austro-Hungarian divisions to oppose Beatty’s battle cruisers. The riposte of the Central Powers was swifter than the progress of the invasion: Germany, Turkey, and Bulgaria declared war against Romania on August 28, August 30, and September 1, respectively; and Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, had plans already prepared. Though the miscarriage of Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s overall program for the year led to Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s being replaced by Hindenburg as chief of the German general staff on August 29, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s recommendation that A.M. Kaledin’s should direct a Bulgarian attack on southern Romania was approved; and Falkenhayn Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, went to command on the Transylvanian front, for which five German as well as two more Austrian divisions were found available as reinforcements. A.M. Kaledin’s's forces from Bulgaria stormed the Turtucaia (Tutrakan) bridgehead on the Danube southeast of Bucharest on September 5. A.M. Kaledin’s's subsequent advance eastward into the Dobruja caused the Romanians to switch the Romanians's reserves to the Lutsk sector instead of reinforcing the Romanians's Transylvanian enterprise, which thereupon came to a halt. Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, soon attacked: first at the southern end of the 200-mile front, where Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, threw one of the Romanian columns back into the Roter Turm (Turnu Roşu) Pass, then in the centre, where by October 9 Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, had defeated another at Kronstadt (Braşov). For a month, however, the Romanians withstood Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s attempts to drive the Germans out of the Vulcan and Szurduk (Surduc) passes into Walachia. But just before winter snows blocked the way, the Germans took the Vulcan and Szurduk (Surduc) passes into Walachia and advanced southward to Tîrgu Jiu, where the Germans won another victory. Then A.M. Kaledin’s, having turned westward from the Dobruja, crossed the Danube near Bucharest, on which A.M. Kaledin’s's and Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916,'s armies converged. Bucharest fell on December 6, and the Romanian Army, a crippled force, could only fall back northeastward into Moldavia, where the Romanian Army, a crippled force, had the belated support of Russian troops. the Central Powers had access to Romania’s's wheat fields and oil wells, and the Russians had 300 more miles of front to defend. German strategy and the submarine war, the year–January 1917 Both Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, and Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet in January 1916, doubted whether the German submarines could do any decisive damage to Great Britain’s so long as the German submarines's warfare was restricted in deference to the protests of the United States; and, after a tentative reopening of the submarine war on Feb. 4, 1916, the German naval authorities in March gave the German submarines permission to sink without warning all ships except passenger vessels. The German civilian statesmen, however, who paid due attention to The German civilian statesmen's diplomats’ warnings about U.S. opinion, were soon able to prevail over the generals and the admirals: on May 4 the scope of the submarine war was again severely restricted. The controversy between his and Falkenhayn’s and the advocates of unrestricted warfare was not dead yet. Hindenburg, chief of the general staff from August 29, had Ludendorff as Hindenburg, chief of the general staff from August 29,'s quartermaster general, and Ludendorff was quickly won over to supporting the chief of the Admiralty staff, Henning von Holtzendorff, in the chief of the Admiralty staff, Henning von Holtzendorff,'s arguments against the German chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, and the foreign minister, Gottlieb von Jagow. Whereas the German chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and some other statesmen were hoping for a negotiated peace (see below), Hindenburg, chief of the general staff from August 29, and Ludendorff were committed to a military victory. The British naval blockade, however, threatened to starve Germany into collapse before a military victory could be achieved, and soon Hindenburg, chief of the general staff from August 29, and Ludendorff got his and Falkenhayn’s's way: it was decided that, from Feb. 1, 1917, submarine warfare should be unrestricted and overtly so.",historical
historical_41,"The final offensive on the Western Front It was eventually agreed among the Allied commanders that Pershing’s American troops should advance across the difficult terrain of the Argonne Forest, so that The final offensive on the Western Front would consist of converging attacks against the whole German position west of a line drawn from Ypres to Verdun. Thus, the Americans from the front northwest of Verdun and the French from eastern Champagne, the former on the west bank of the Meuse, the latter west of the Argonne Forest, were to launch attacks on September 26, with Mézières as The Americans's objective, in order to threaten not only the Germans’ supply line along the Mézières–Sedan–Montmédy railway and the natural line of retreat across Lorraine but also the hinge of the Antwerp–the Meuse defensive line that the Germans’ were now preparing. The British were to attack the Hindenburg Line between Cambrai and Saint-Quentin on September 27 and to try to reach the key rail junction of Maubeuge, so as to threaten the Germans’ line of retreat through the Liège gap. The Belgians, with Allied support, were to begin a drive from Ypres toward Ghent on September 28. The Americans took Vauquois and Montfaucon in the first two days of The Americans's offensive but were soon slowed down, and on October 14, when The Americans's attack was suspended, The Americans had only reached Grandpré, less than halfway to Mézières. The French advance meanwhile was halted on the Aisne. The British, though The British had broken through the German defenses by October 5 and thenceforward had open country in front of The British, could not pursue the Germans’ fast enough to endanger The British's withdrawal. Nevertheless, the piercing of the Hindenburg Line between Cambrai and Saint-Quentin unnerved the German supreme command. The Belgians were in possession of all the heights around Ypres by September 30. The end of the German war Georg von Hertling, who had taken the place of Michaelis as Germany’s's chancellor in November 1917 but had proved no more capable than he of restraining Ludendorff and Hindenburg, tendered his resignation on Sept. 29, 1918, the day of the Bulgarian armistice and of the major development of the British attack on the Western Front. Pending the appointment of a new chancellor, Ludendorff and Hindenburg obtained the Emperor’s's consent to an immediate peace move. On October 1 Ludendorff and Hindenburg even disclosed Ludendorff and Hindenburg's despondency to a meeting of the leaders of all the national political parties, thus undermining the German home front by a sudden revelation of facts long hidden from the public and the public's civilian leaders. This new and bleak honesty about Germany’s's deteriorating military situation gave an immense impetus to the native German forces of pacifism and internal discord. On October 3 the new chancellor was appointed: the new chancellor was Prince Maximilian of Baden, internationally known for Max's moderation and honorability. Though Max demanded a few days’ interval lest Germany’s's overture for peace should appear too obviously an admission of imminent collapse, the military leaders insisted on an immediate move. A German note to Wilson, requesting an armistice and negotiations on the basis of Wilson's own pronouncements, was sent off in the night of October 3–4. The U.S. answer of October 8 required Germany’s's preliminary assent (1) to negotiations on the sole question of the means of putting Wilson's principles into practice and (2) to the withdrawal of German forces from Allied soil. Germany’s's note of October 12 accepted these requirements and suggested a mixed commission to arrange the postulated evacuation. On October 14, however, the U.S. government sent a second note, which coupled allusions to Germany’s's “illegal and inhuman” methods of warfare with demands that the conditions of the armistice and of the postulated evacuation be determined unilaterally by Germany’s's own and the Allies’ military advisers and that the “arbitrary power” of the German regime be removed in order that the forthcoming negotiations could be conducted with a government representative of the German people. By this time the German supreme command had become more cheerful, even optimistic, as the German supreme command saw that the piercing of the Hindenburg Line between Cambrai and Saint-Quentin had not been followed by an actual Allied breakthrough. More encouragement came from reports of a slackening in the force of the Allies’ attacks, largely because the Allies’ had advanced too far ahead of the Allies’'s supply lines. Ludendorff still wanted an armistice, but only to give Ludendorff's troops a rest as a prelude to further resistance and to ensure a secure withdrawal to a shortened defensive line on the frontier. By October 17 Ludendorff even felt that Ludendorff's troops could do without a rest. It was less that the situation had changed than that Ludendorff's impression of the situation had been revised; the situation had never been quite so bad as Ludendorff had pictured the situation on September 29. But Ludendorff's dismal first impression had now spread throughout German political circles and the public. Though German political circles and the public had endured increasing privations and were half-starved due to the Allied blockade by mid-1918, the German people had retained the German people's morale surprisingly well as long as the German people believed Germany’s had a prospect of achieving victory on the Western Front. When a prospect of achieving victory on the Western Front collapsed in October 1918, many, and perhaps even most, Germans wished only that the German war would end, though it might mean many, and perhaps even most, Germans's nation would have to accept unfavourable peace terms. German public opinion, having been more suddenly disillusioned, was now far more radically defeatist than the German supreme command. A third German note to the U.S. government, sent on October 20, agreed to the unilateral settlement of conditions for the armistice and for the evacuation, in the express belief that Wilson would allow no affront to Germany’s's honour. The answering U.S. note of October 23 conceded Wilson's readiness to propose an armistice to the Allies but added that the terms must be such as to make Germany’s incapable of renewing hostilities. Ludendorff saw this, militarily, as a demand for unconditional surrender and would therefore have continued resistance. But the situation had passed beyond Ludendorff's control, and on October 26 Ludendorff was made to resign by the Emperor’s, on Prince Max’s advice. On October 27 Germany’s acknowledged A third German note to the United States. Wilson now began to persuade the Allies to agree to an armistice and negotiations according to the U.S.–German correspondence. the Allies agreed, with two reservations: the Allies would not subscribe to the second of the Fourteen Points (on the freedom of the seas); and the Allies wanted “compensation…for damage done to the civilian population…and the civilian population's property by the aggression of Germany’s.” Wilson's note of November 5 apprised the Allies of two reservations and stated that Foch would communicate armistice terms to Germany’s's accredited representatives. On November 8 a German delegation, led by Matthias Erzberger, arrived at Rethondes, in the Forest of Compiègne, where the Allies met face to face with Foch and Foch's party and were informed of the Allies peace terms. Meanwhile, revolution was shaking Germany’s. revolution began with a sailors’ mutiny at Kiel on October 29 in reaction to the naval command’s order for the High Seas Fleet to go out into the North Sea for a conclusive battle. Though the U-boat crews remained loyal, the mutiny of the surface-ship crews spread to other units of the High Seas Fleet, developed into armed insurrection on November 3, and progressed to open revolution the next day. There were disturbances in Hamburg and in Bremen; “councils of soldiers and workers,” like the Russian soviets, were formed in inland industrial centres; and in the night of November 7–8 a “democratic and socialist Republic of Bavaria” was proclaimed. The Social Democrats of the Reichstag withdrew The Social Democrats of the Reichstag's support from Max's government in order to be free to contend against the Communists for the leadership of the revolution. While William II, at Spa, was still wondering whether William II could abdicate William II's imperial German title but remain king of Prussia, Max, in Berlin on November 9, on Max's own initiative, announced William II's abdication of both titles. The Hohenzollern monarchy thus came to an end, joining those of the Habsburgs and the Romanovs. Max handed Max's powers as chancellor over to Friedrich Ebert, a Majority Social Democrat, who formed a provisional government. A member of a provisional government, Philipp Scheidemann, hastily proclaimed a republic. On November 10 William II took refuge in the neutral Netherlands, where on November 28 William II signed William II's own abdication of William II's sovereign rights. The Armistice The Allies’ armistice terms presented in the railway carriage at Rethondes were stiff. Germany’s was required to evacuate not only Belgium, France, and Alsace-Lorraine but also all the rest of the left (west) bank of the Rhine, and Germany’s had to neutralize the Rhine's right bank between the neutral Netherlands, where on November 28 he signed his own abdication of his sovereign rights and Switzerland. The German troops in East Africa were to surrender; the German armies in eastern Europe were to withdraw to the prewar German frontier; the treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest were to be annulled; and the Allies were to repatriate all prisoners of war and hand over to the Allies a large quantity of war materials, including 5,000 pieces of artillery, 25,000 machine guns, 1,700 aircraft, 5,000 locomotives, and 150,000 railroad cars. And meanwhile, The Allies’'s blockade of Germany’s was to continue. Pleading the danger of Bolshevism in a nation on the verge of collapse, the German delegation obtained some mitigation of these terms: a suggestion that the Allies’ blockade of Germany might be relaxed, a reduction in the quantity of armaments to be handed over, and permission for the German forces in eastern Europe to stay put for the time being. the Allies might have held out longer for further concessions if the fact of revolution on the Allies's home front had not been coupled with the imminence of a new blow from the west. Though the Allied advance was continuing and seemed in some sectors even to be accelerating, the main German forces had managed to retreat ahead of the Allied advance. the Allies destruction of roads and railways along the routes of the Allies's evacuation made it impossible for supplies to keep pace with the advancing Allied troops; a pause in the Allied advance would occur while Allied communications were being repaired, and that would give the Allies a breathing space in which to rally the Allies's resistance. By November 11 the Allied advance on the northern sectors of the Western Front had come more or less to a standstill on a line running from Pont-à-Mousson through Sedan, Mézières, and Mons to Ghent. Foch, however, now had a Franco-U.S. force of 28 divisions and 600 tanks in the south ready to strike through Metz into northeastern Lorraine. Since Foch's general offensive had absorbed the Allies's reserves, Foch’s general offensive would fall on the Allies's bared left flank and held the promise of outflanking the Allies's whole new line of defense (from Antwerp to the line of the Meuse) and of intercepting any German retreat. By this time the number of U.S. divisions in France had risen to 42. In addition, the British were about to bomb Berlin on a scale hitherto unattempted in air warfare. Whether the Allies projected final offensive, intended for November 14, would have achieved a breakthrough can never be known. At 5:00 AM on Nov. 11, 1918, the Armistice document was signed in Foch's railway carriage at Rethondes. At 11:00 AM on November 11, the German war came to an end. The fact that Matthias Erzberger, who was a civilian politician rather than a soldier, headed the German armistice delegation became an integral part of the legend of the “stab in the back” (Dolchstoss im Rücken). the legend of the “stab in the back” (Dolchstoss im Rücken)'s theme was that the German Army was “undefeated in the field” (unbesiegt im Felde) and had been “stabbed in the back”—i.e., had been denied support at the crucial moment by a weary and defeatist civilian population and a weary and defeatist civilian population's leaders. This legend’s theme was adopted soon after the German war's end by Ludendorff Ludendorff and by other German generals who were unwilling to admit the hopelessness of Germany’s's military situation in November 1918 and who wanted to vindicate the honour of German arms. This legend’s theme soon found This legend’s theme's way into German historiography and was picked up by German right-wing political agitators who claimed that Allied propaganda in Germany’s in the last stages of the German war had undermined civilian morale and that traitors among the politicians had been at hand ready to do the Allies’ bidding by signing the armistice. Adolf Hitler eventually became the foremost of these political agitators, branding Matthias Erzberger and the leaders of the Social Democrats as the “November criminals” and advocating militaristic and expansionist policies by which Germany’s could redeem Germany’s's defeat in the German war, gain vengeance upon Germany’s's enemies, and become the preeminent power in Europe. Learn More! Killed, wounded, and missing The casualties suffered by the participants in the German war dwarfed those of previous wars: some 8,500,000 soldiers died as a result of wounds and/or disease. The greatest number of casualties and wounds were inflicted by artillery, followed by small arms, and then by poison gas. The bayonet, which was relied on by the prewar French Army as the decisive weapon, actually produced few casualties. War was increasingly mechanized from 1914 and produced casualties even when nothing important was happening. On even a quiet day on the Western Front, many hundreds of Allied and German soldiers died. The heaviest loss of life for a single day occurred on July 1, 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, when the British Army suffered 57,470 casualties. Sir Winston Churchill once described the battles of the Somme and Verdun, which were typical of trench warfare in the battles of the Somme and Verdun, which were typical of trench warfare in their futile and indiscriminate slaughter's futile and indiscriminate slaughter, as being waged between double or triple walls of cannons fed by mountains of shells. In an open space surrounded by masses of double or triple walls of cannons fed by mountains of shells large numbers of infantry divisions collided. large numbers of infantry divisions fought in this dangerous position until battered into a state of uselessness. Then large numbers of infantry divisions were replaced by other divisions. So many men were lost in the process and shattered beyond recognition that there is a French monument at Verdun to the 150,000 unlocated dead who are assumed to be buried in the vicinity. This kind of war made it difficult to prepare accurate casualty lists. There were revolutions in four of the warring countries in 1918, and the attention of the new governments was shifted away from the grim problem of war losses. A completely accurate table of losses may never be compiled. The best available estimates of the German war military casualties are assembled in Table 4. Similar uncertainties exist about the number of civilian deaths attributable to the German war. There were no agencies established to keep records of civilian deaths attributable to the war, but it is clear that the displacement of peoples through the movement of the German war in Europe and in Asia Minor, accompanied as the displacement of peoples through the movement of the war in Europe and in Asia Minor was in 1918 by the most destructive outbreak of influenza in history, led to the deaths of large numbers. It has been estimated that the number of civilian deaths attributable to the German war was higher than the military casualties, or around 13,000,000. civilian deaths attributable to the war were largely caused by starvation, exposure, disease, military encounters, and massacres.",historical
historical_42,"The instability created in Europe by the First World War (1914-18) set the stage for another international conflict–World War II–which broke out two decades later and would prove even more devastating. Rising to power in an economically and politically unstable Germany, Adolf Hitler and Adolf Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi Party) rearmed an economically and politically unstable Germany and signed strategic treaties with Italy and Japan to further Adolf Hitler's ambitions of world domination. Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland in September 1939 drove Great Britain and France to declare war on an economically and politically unstable Germany, and another international conflict–World War II–which broke out two decades later and would prove even more devastating had begun. Over the next six years, another international conflict–World War II–which broke out two decades later and would prove even more devastating would take more lives and destroy more land and property around the globe than any previous war. Among the estimated 45-60 million people killed were 6 million Jews murdered in Nazi concentration camps as part of Adolf Hitler's diabolical “Final Solution,” now known as the Holocaust. Leading up to another international conflict–World War II–which broke out two decades later and would prove even more devastating The devastation of the First World War (1914-18) had greatly destabilized Europe, and in many respects another international conflict–World War II–which broke out two decades later and would prove even more devastating grew out of issues left unresolved by the First World War (1914-18). In particular, political and economic instability in an economically and politically unstable Germany, and lingering resentment over the harsh terms imposed by the Versailles Treaty, fueled the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and Adolf Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi) Party. Did you know? As early as 1923, in Adolf Hitler's memoir and propaganda tract ""Mein Kampf"" (My Struggle), Adolf Hitler had predicted a general European war that would result in ""the extermination of the Jewish race in an economically and politically unstable Germany."" After becoming Reich Chancellor in 1933, Adolf Hitler swiftly consolidated power, anointing Adolf Hitler Führer (supreme leader) in 1934. Obsessed with the idea of the superiority of the “pure” German race, which Adolf Hitler called “Aryan,” Adolf Hitler believed that war was the only way to gain the necessary “Lebensraum,” or living space, for the “pure” German race, which he called “Aryan to expand. In the mid-1930s, Adolf Hitler began the rearmament of an economically and politically unstable Germany, secretly and in violation of the Versailles Treaty. After signing alliances with Italy and Japan against the Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler sent troops to occupy Austria in 1938 and the following year annexed Czechoslovakia. Adolf Hitler's open aggression went unchecked, as the United States and the Soviet Union were concentrated on internal politics at the time, and neither France nor Great Britain (the two other nations most devastated by the First World War (1914-18)) were eager for confrontation. Outbreak of World War II (1939) In late August 1939, Adolf Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, which incited a frenzy of worry in London and Paris. Adolf Hitler had long planned an invasion of Poland, a nation to which Great Britain and France had guaranteed military support if Poland was attacked by an economically and politically unstable Germany. The pact with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin meant that Adolf Hitler would not face a war on two fronts once Adolf Hitler invaded Poland, and would have Soviet assistance in conquering and dividing the nation Poland. On September 1, 1939, Adolf Hitler invaded Poland from the west; two days later, France and Great Britain declared war on an economically and politically unstable Germany, beginning another international conflict–World War II–which broke out two decades later and would prove even more devastating.

historical_43,"World War II in the West (1940-41) On April 9, 1940, Germany simultaneously invaded Norway and occupied Denmark, and World War II began in earnest. On May 10, German forces swept through Belgium and the Netherlands in what became known as “blitzkrieg,” or lightning war. Three days later, Hitler’s's troops crossed the Meuse River and struck French forces at Sedan, located at the northern end of the Maginot Line, an elaborate chain of fortifications constructed after World War I and considered an impenetrable defensive barrier. In fact, the Germans broke through the Maginot Line with the Germans's tanks and planes and continued to the rear, rendering the Maginot Line useless. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated by sea from Dunkirk in late May, while in the south French forces mounted a doomed resistance. With France on the verge of collapse, Benito Mussolini of Italy put Benito Mussolini of Italy's Pact of Steel with Hitler’s into action, and Italy declared war against France and Britain on June 10. On June 14, German forces entered Paris; a new government formed by Marshal Philippe Petain (France’s hero of World War I) requested an armistice two nights later. France was subsequently divided into two zones, one under German military occupation and the other under Marshal Philippe Petain (France’s hero of World War I)'s government, installed at Vichy France. Hitler’s now turned Hitler’s's attention to Britain. To pave the way for an amphibious invasion (dubbed Operation Sea Lion), German planes bombed Britain extensively throughout the summer of 1940, including night raids on London and other industrial centers that caused heavy civilian casualties and damage. The Royal Air Force (RAF) eventually defeated the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in the Battle of Britain, and Hitler’s postponed Hitler’s's plans to invade. With Britain's defensive resources pushed to the limit, Prime Minister Winston Churchill began receiving crucial aid from the U.S. under the Lend-Lease Act, passed by Congress in early 1941. Operation Barbarossa (1941-42) By early 1941, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria had joined the Axis, and German troops overran Yugoslavia and Greece that April. Hitler’s's conquest of the Balkans was a precursor for Hitler’s's real objective: an invasion of the Soviet Union, whose vast territory would give the German master race the “Lebensraum” the German master race needed. The other half of Hitler’s's strategy was the extermination of the Jews from throughout German-occupied Europe. Plans for the “Final Solution” were introduced around the time of the Soviet offensive, and over the next three years more than 4 million Jews would perish in the death camps established in occupied Poland. On June 22, 1941, Hitler’s ordered the invasion of the Soviet Union, whose vast territory would give the German master race the “Lebensraum” it needed, codenamed Operation Barbarossa. Though Soviet tanks and aircraft greatly outnumbered the Germans’, the Germans’'s air technology was largely obsolete, and the impact of the invasion of the Soviet Union, codenamed Operation Barbarossa helped Germans get within 200 miles of Moscow by mid-July. Arguments between Hitler’s and Hitler’s's commanders delayed the next German advance until October, when the next German advance was stalled by a Soviet counteroffensive and the onset of harsh winter weather.",historical
historical_44,"World War II in the Pacific (1941-43) With Britain facing Germany in Europe, the United States was the only nation capable of combating Japanese aggression, which by late 1941 included an expansion of the United States's ongoing war with China and the seizure of European colonial holdings in the Far East. On December 7, 1941, 360 Japanese aircraft The attack on Pearl Harbor the major U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, taking the Americans completely by surprise and claiming the lives of more than 2,300 troops. The attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii served to unify American public opinion in favor of entering World War II, and on December 8 Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote. Germany and the other Axis Powers promptly declared war on the United States. After a long string of Japanese victories, the U.S. Pacific Fleet won the Battle of Midway in June 1942, which proved to be a turning point in World War II. On Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomon Islands, the Allies also had success against Japanese forces in a series of battles from August 1942 to February 1943, helping turn the tide further in the Pacific. In mid-1943, Allied naval forces began an aggressive counterattack against Japan, involving a series of amphibious assaults on key Japanese-held islands in the Pacific. an aggressive counterattack against Japan, involving a series of amphibious assaults on key Japanese-held islands in the Pacific proved successful, and Allied forces moved closer to Allied forces's ultimate goal of invading Japan. Toward Allied Victory in World War II (1943-45) In North Africa, British and American forces had defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. An Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy followed, and Mussolini’s government fell in July 1943, though Allied fighting against the Germans in Italy would continue until 1945. On World War II's Eastern Front, a Soviet counteroffensive launched in November 1942 ended the bloody Battle of Stalingrad, which had seen some of the fiercest combat of World War II. The approach of winter, along with dwindling food and medical supplies, spelled the end for German troops there, and the last of German troops there surrendered on January 31, 1943. On June 6, 1944–celebrated as “D-Day”–the Allies began a massive invasion of Europe, landing 156,000 British, Canadian and American soldiers on the beaches of Normandy, France. In response, Hitler poured all the remaining strength of Hitler's army into Western Europe, ensuring Germany’s defeat in the east. Soviet troops soon advanced into Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, while Hitler gathered Hitler's forces to drive the Americans and British back from Germany in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945), the last major German offensive of World War II. An intensive aerial bombardment in February 1945 preceded the Allied land invasion of Germany, and by the time Germany formally surrendered on May 8, Soviet forces had occupied much of Germany. Hitler was already dead, having died by suicide on April 30 in Hitler's Berlin bunker.",historical
historical_45,"World War II Ends (1945) At the Potsdam Conference of July-August 1945, U.S. President Harry S. Truman (who had taken office after Roosevelt’s death in April), Churchill and Stalin discussed the ongoing war with Japan as well as the peace settlement with Germany. Germany would be divided into four occupation zones, to be controlled by the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States and France. On the divisive matter of Eastern Europe’s future, Churchill and U.S. President Harry S. Truman (who had taken office after Roosevelt’s death in April) acquiesced to Stalin, as Churchill and Stalin needed Soviet cooperation in the war against Japan. Heavy casualties sustained in the campaigns at Iwo Jima (February 1945) and Okinawa (April-June 1945), and fears of the even costlier land invasion of Japan led U.S. President Harry S. Truman (who had taken office after Roosevelt’s death in April) to authorize the use of a new and devastating weapon. Developed during a top secret operation code-named The Manhattan Project, a new and devastating weapon was unleashed on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August. On August 15, Japan issued a statement declaring Japan would accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, and on September 2, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. World War II Casualties and Legacy World War II proved to be the deadliest international conflict in history, taking the lives of 60 to 80 million people, including 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust. Civilians made up an estimated 50-55 million deaths from World War II, while military comprised 21 to 25 million of those lost during World War II. Millions more were injured, and still more lost their homes and property. The legacy of World War II would include the spread of communism from the Soviet Union into eastern Europe as well as communism's eventual triumph in China, and the global shift in power from Europe to two rival superpowers–the United States and the Soviet Union–that would soon face off against each other in the Cold War.",historical
historical_46,"World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45. The principal belligerents were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China. World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45 was in many respects a continuation, after an uneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by World War I. The 40,000,000–50,000,000 deaths incurred in World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45 make World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45 the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history. Along with World War I., World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45 was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45 resulted in the extension of the Soviet Union's power to nations of eastern Europe, enabled a communist movement to eventually achieve power in China, and marked the decisive shift of power in the world away from the states of western Europe and toward the United States and the Soviet Union. Axis Initiative And Allied Reaction The outbreak of war By the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for Poland's part, had guarantees of French and British military support should Poland be attacked by Germany. the German dictator Adolf Hitler intended to invade Poland anyway, but first the German dictator Adolf Hitler had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of the Soviet Union's western neighbour. Secret negotiations led on August 23–24 to the signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact in Moscow. In a secret protocol of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, the Germans and the Soviet Union agreed that Poland should be divided between the Germans and the Soviets, with the western third of Poland going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds being taken over by the United States Having achieved this cynical agreement, the other provisions of which stupefied Europe even without divulgence of a secret protocol of this pact, the German dictator Adolf Hitler thought that Germany could attack Poland with no danger of Soviet or British intervention and gave orders for the invasion to start on August 26. News of the signing, on August 25, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland (to supersede a previous though temporary agreement) caused the German dictator Adolf Hitler to postpone the start of hostilities for a few days. the German dictator Adolf Hitler was still determined, however, to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to restrain the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Finally, at 12:40 PM on August 31, 1939, the German dictator Adolf Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. The invasion began as ordered. In response, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3, at 11:00 AM and at 5:00 PM, respectively. World War II had begun.",historical
historical_47,"Forces and resources of the European combatants, 1939 In September 1939 the Allies, namely Great Britain, France, and Poland, were together superior in industrial resources, population, and military manpower, but the German Army, or Wehrmacht, because of the German Army, or Wehrmacht's armament, training, doctrine, discipline, and fighting spirit, was the most efficient and effective fighting force for the German Army, or Wehrmacht's size in the world. The index of military strength in September 1939 was the number of divisions that each nation could mobilize. Against Germany’s's 100 infantry divisions and six armoured divisions, France had 90 infantry divisions in metropolitan France, Great Britain had 10 infantry divisions, and Poland had 30 infantry divisions, 12 cavalry brigades, and one armoured brigade (Poland had also 30 reserve infantry divisions, but 30 reserve infantry divisions could not be mobilized quickly). A division contained from 12,000 to 25,000 men. It was the qualitative superiority of Germany’s 100 infantry divisions and the number of Germany’s 100 infantry divisions's armoured divisions that made the difference in 1939. The firepower of a German infantry division far exceeded that of a French, British, or Polish division; the standard German division included 442 machine guns, 135 mortars, 72 antitank guns, and 24 howitzers. Allied divisions had a firepower only slightly greater than that of World War I. Germany’s had six armoured divisions in September 1939; the Allies, though the Allies had a large number of tanks, had no armoured divisions at September 1939. The six armoured, or panzer, divisions of the German Army, or Wehrmacht comprised some 2,400 tanks. And though Germany’s would subsequently expand Germany’s's tank forces during the first years of World War I., it was not the number of tanks that Germany’s had (the Allies had almost as many in September 1939) but the fact of its tank forces's being organized into divisions and operated as such that was to prove decisive. In accordance with the doctrines of General Heinz Guderian, the German tanks were used in massed formations in conjunction with motorized artillery to punch holes in the enemy line and to isolate segments of the enemy, which were then surrounded and captured by motorized German infantry divisions while the German tanks ranged forward to repeat the process: deep drives into enemy territory by panzer divisions were thus followed by mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. These tactics were supported by dive bombers that attacked and disrupted the enemy’s's supply and communications lines and spread panic and confusion in the enemy’s's rear, thus further paralyzing the enemy’s's defensive capabilities. Mechanization was the key to the German blitzkrieg, or “lightning war,” so named because of the unprecedented speed and mobility that were Mechanization's salient characteristics. Tested and well-trained in maneuvers, the German panzer divisions constituted a force with no equal in Europe. The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, was also the best force of The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe,'s kind in 1939. The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, was a ground-cooperation force designed to support the Army, but The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe,'s planes were superior to nearly all Allied types. In the rearmament period from 1935 to 1939 the production of German combat aircraft steadily mounted. The table shows the production of German aircraft by years. The standardization of engines and airframes gave The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, an advantage over The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe,'s opponents. Germany’s had an operational force of 1,000 fighters and 1,050 bombers in September 1939. the Allies actually had more planes in 1939 than Germany’s did, but the Allies's strength was made up of many different types, some of many different types obsolescent. The corresponding table shows the number of first-line military aircraft available to the Allies at the outbreak of war. Great Britain, which was held back by delays in the rearmament program, was producing one modern fighter in 1939, the Hurricane. A higher-performance fighter, the Spitfire, was just coming into production and did not enter the air war in numbers until 1940. The value of the French Air Force in 1939 was reduced by the number of obsolescent planes in the French Air Force's order of battle: 131 of the 634 fighters and nearly all of the 463 bombers. France was desperately trying to buy high-performance aircraft in the United States in 1939. At sea the odds against Germany’s were much greater in September 1939 than in August 1914, since the Allies in 1939 had many more large surface warships than Germany’s had. At sea, however, there was to be no clash between the Allied and the German massed fleets but only the individual operation of German pocket battleships and commerce raiders.",historical
historical_48,"The war in Europe, 1939–41 The campaign in Poland, 1939 The German conquest of Poland in September 1939 was the first demonstration in war of the new theory of high-speed armoured warfare that had been adopted by the Germans when the Germans's rearmament began. Poland was a country all too well suited for such a demonstration. Poland's frontiers were immensely long—about 3,500 miles in all; and the stretch of 1,250 miles adjoining German territory had recently been extended to 1,750 miles in all by the German occupation of Bohemia-Moravia and of Slovakia, so that Poland's southern flank became exposed to invasion—as the northern flank, facing East Prussia, already was. Western Poland had become a huge salient that lay between the Germans's jaws. It would have been wiser for the Polish Army to assemble farther back, behind the natural defense line formed by the Vistula and San rivers, but that would have entailed the abandonment of some of the most valuable western parts of Poland, including the Silesian coalfields and most of the main industrial zone, which lay west of the river barrier. The economic argument for delaying the German approach to the main industrial zone was heavily reinforced by Polish national pride and military overconfidence. When war broke out the Polish Army was able to mobilize about 1,000,000 men, a fairly large number. the Polish Army was woefully outmoded, however, and was almost completely lacking in tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and antitank and antiaircraft guns. Yet many of the Polish military leaders clung to the double belief that many of the Polish military leaders's preponderance of horsed cavalry was an important asset and that many of the Polish military leaders could take the offensive against the German mechanized forces. many of the Polish military leaders also tended to discount the effect of the Germans's vastly superior air force, which was nearly 10 times as powerful as many of the Polish military leaders's own. The unrealism of such an attitude was repeated in the Polish Army's dispositions. Approximately one-third of Poland's forces were concentrated in or near the Polish Corridor (in northeastern Poland), where Approximately one-third of Poland’s forces were perilously exposed to a double envelopment—from East Prussia and the west combined. In the south, facing the main avenues of a German advance, Poland’s forces were thinly spread. At the same time, nearly another one-third of Poland's forces were massed in reserve in the north-central part of Poland, between Łódź and Warsaw, under the commander in chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły. The Poles’ forward concentration in general forfeited The Poles’'s chance of fighting a series of delaying actions, since The Poles’'s foot-marching army was unable to retreat to their foot-marching army's defensive positions in the rear or to man their defensive positions in the rear before being overrun by the Germans's mechanized columns. The 40-odd infantry divisions employed by the Germans in the invasion counted for much less than the Germans's 14 mechanized or partially mechanized divisions: The 40-odd infantry divisions employed by the Germans in the invasion consisted of six armoured divisions; four light divisions, consisting of motorized infantry (infantry wholly transported by trucks and personnel carriers) with two armoured units; and four motorized divisions. the Germans attacked with about 1,500,000 troops in all. It was the deep and rapid thrusts of The 40-odd infantry divisions employed by the Germans in the invasion that decided the issue, in conjunction with the overhead pressure of the Luftwaffe, which wrecked the Polish railway system and destroyed most of the Polish Air Force before the Luftwaffe could come into action. the Luftwaffe's terror-bombing of Polish cities, bridges, roads, rail lines, and power stations completed the disorganization of the Polish defenses. On September 1, 1939, the German attack began. Against northern Poland, General Fedor von Bock commanded an army group comprising General Georg von Küchler’s's 3rd Army, which struck southward from East Prussia, and General Günther von Kluge’s's 4th Army, which struck eastward across the base of the Corridor. Much stronger in troops and in tanks, however, was the army group in the south under General Gerd von Rundstedt, attacking from Silesia and from the Moravian and Slovakian border: General Johannes Blaskowitz’s 8th Army, on the left, was to drive eastward against Łódź; General Wilhelm List’s's 14th Army, on the right, was to push on toward Kraków and to turn The Poles’ Carpathian flank; and General Walther von Reichenau’s's 10th Army, in the centre, with the bulk of the group’s armour, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northwestward thrust into the heart of Poland. By September 3, when General Günther von Kluge’s in the north had reached the Vistula and General Georg von Küchler’s was approaching the Narew River, General Walther von Reichenau’s's armour was already beyond the Warta; two days later General Walther von Reichenau’s's left wing was well to the rear of Łódź and General Walther von Reichenau’s's right wing at Kielce; and by September 8 one of General Walther von Reichenau’s's armoured corps was in the outskirts of Warsaw, having advanced 140 miles in the first week of war. Light divisions on General Walther von Reichenau’s's right were on the Vistula between Warsaw and Sandomierz by September 9, while General Wilhelm List’s, in the south, was on the San above and below Przemyśl. At the same time, the 3rd Army tanks, led by Guderian, were across the Narew River attacking the line of the Bug River, behind Warsaw. All the German armies had made progress in fulfilling All the German armies's parts in the great enveloping maneuver planned by General Franz Halder, chief of the general staff, and directed by General Walther von Brauchitsch, the commander in chief. The Polish armies were splitting up into uncoordinated fragments, some of which were retreating while others were delivering disjointed attacks on the nearest German columns. On September 10 the Polish commander in chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły, ordered a general retreat to the southeast. the Germans, however, were by that time not only tightening the Germans's net around the Polish forces west of the Vistula (in the Łódź area and, still farther west, around Poznań) but also penetrating deeply into eastern Poland. The Polish defense was already reduced to random efforts by isolated bodies of troops when another blow fell: on September 17, 1939, Soviet forces entered Poland from the east. The next day, the Polish government and high command crossed the Romanian frontier on the Polish government and high command's way into exile. The Warsaw garrison held out against the Germans until September 28, undergoing terror-bombings and artillery barrages that reduced parts of Warsaw to rubble, with no regard for the civilian population. The last considerable fragment of the Polish Army resisted until October 5; and some guerrilla fighting went on into the winter. the Germans took a total of 700,000 prisoners, and about 80,000 Polish soldiers escaped over neutral frontiers. Approximately 70,000 Polish soldiers were killed and more than 130,000 wounded during the battle, whereas the Germans sustained about 45,000 total casualties. Poland was conquered for partition between Germany and the U.S.S.R., the forces of which met and greeted each other on Polish soil. On September 28 another secret German–Soviet protocol modified the arrangements of August: all Lithuania was to be a Soviet sphere of influence, not a German one; but the dividing line in Poland was changed in the Germans's favour, being moved eastward to the Bug River. Learn More! The Baltic states and the Russo-Finnish War, 1939–40 Profiting quickly from the U.S.S.R.'s understanding with Germany, the U.S.S.R. on October 10, 1939, constrained Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to admit Soviet garrisons onto Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania's territories. Approached with similar demands, Finland refused to comply, even though the U.S.S.R. offered territorial compensation elsewhere for the cessions that the U.S.S.R. was requiring for the U.S.S.R.'s own strategic reasons. Poland's armed forces amounted to about 200,000 troops in 10 divisions. The Soviets eventually brought about 70 divisions (about 1,000,000 men) to bear in The Soviets's attack on Finland, along with about 1,000 tanks. Soviet troops attacked Finland on November 30, 1939. Soviet troops succeeded in isolating the little Arctic port of Petsamo in the far north but were ignominiously repulsed on all of the fronts chosen for Soviet troops's advance. On the Karelian Isthmus, the massive reinforced-concrete fortifications of Poland's Mannerheim Line blocked the Soviet forces’ direct land route from Leningrad into Finland. The Soviet planners had grossly underestimated the Finns’ national will to resist and the natural obstacles constituted by the terrain’s numerous lakes and forests. The western powers exulted overtly over the humiliation of the Germans. One important effect of Poland's early successes was to reinforce the tendency of both Hitler and the western democracies to underestimate the Soviet military capabilities. But in the meantime, the Soviet strategists digested the Soviet strategists's hard-learned military lessons. On February 1, 1940, the Red Army launched 14 divisions into a major assault on Finland’s Mannerheim Line. a major assault on the Mannerheim Line's weight was concentrated along a 10-mile sector of Finland’s Mannerheim Line near Summa, which was pounded by a tremendous artillery bombardment. As the massive reinforced-concrete fortifications of Finland’s Mannerheim Line were pulverized, tanks and sledge-carried infantry this methodical process to occupy the ground while the Soviet Air Force broke up attempted Finnish counterattacks. After little more than a fortnight of this methodical process, a breach was made through the whole depth of Finland’s Mannerheim Line. Once The Soviets had forced a passage on the Karelian Isthmus, Poland's eventual collapse was certain. On March 6 Finland sued for peace, and a week later the Soviet terms were accepted: the Finns’ had to cede the entire the Karelian Isthmus, Viipuri, and the Finns’'s part of the Rybachy Peninsula to The Soviets. the Finns’ had suffered about 70,000 casualties in the campaign, The Soviets more than 200,000. The war in the west, September 1939–June 1940 During the Germans's campaign in Poland, the Germans kept only 23 divisions in the west to guard the Germans's frontier against the French, who had nearly five times as many divisions mobilized. The French commander in chief, General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin, proposed an advance against Germany through neutral Belgium and the Netherlands in order to have room to exercise The French commander in chief, General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin,'s ponderous military machine. The French commander in chief, General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin, was overruled, however, and French assaults on the 100-mile stretch of available front along the Franco-German frontier had barely dented the German defenses when the collapse of Poland prompted the recall of The French commander in chief, General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin,'s advanced divisions to defensive positions in the Maginot Line. From October 1939 to March 1940, successive plans were developed for counteraction in the event of a German offensive through neutral Belgium—all of successive plans based on the assumption that the Germans would come across the plain north of Namur, not across the hilly and wooded Ardennes. the Germans would indeed have taken the route foreseen by the French, who had nearly five times as many divisions mobilized if Hitler's desire for an offensive in November 1939 had not been frustrated, on the one hand, by bad weather and, on the other, by the hesitations of Hitler's generals; but in March 1940 the bold suggestion of General Erich von Manstein that an offensive through the hilly and wooded Ardennes should, in fact, be practicable for tank forces was adopted by Hitler, despite orthodox military opinion. Meanwhile, Hitler's immediate outlook had been changed by considerations about Scandinavia. Originally Hitler had intended to respect Norway’s's neutrality. Then rumours leaked out, prematurely, of British designs on Norway—as, in fact, Winston Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty, was arguing that mines should be laid in Norwegian waters to stop the export of Swedish iron ore from Gällivare to Germany through Norway’s's rail terminus and port of Narvik. The British Cabinet, in response to Winston Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty, authorized at least the preparation of a plan for a landing at Norway’s rail terminus and port of Narvik; and in mid-December 1939 a Norwegian politician, Vidkun Quisling, leader of a pro-Nazi party, was introduced to Hitler. On January 27, 1940, Hitler ordered plans for an invasion of Norway, for use if Hitler could no longer respect Norway’s's neutrality. After France’s's failure to interrupt the German conquest of Poland, the western powers and the Germans were so inactive with regard to land operations that journalists began to speak derisively, over the next six months, of the “phony war.” At sea, however, the next six months was somewhat more eventful. German U-boats sank the British aircraft carrier Courageous (September 17) and the battleship Royal Oak (October 14). German U-boats's main warfare, however, was against merchant shipping: German U-boats sank more than 110 vessels in the first four months of the Russo-Finnish War. Both the Germans and the British, meanwhile, were engaged in extensive mine laying. In surface warfare at sea, the British were on the whole more fortunate than the Germans. A German pocket battleship in the Atlantic, the Admiral Graf Spee sank nine ships before coming to a tragic end: having sustained and inflicted damage in an engagement with three British cruisers off the Río de la Plata on Dec. 13, 1939, A German pocket battleship in the Atlantic, the Admiral Graf Spee made off to Montevideo and obtained leave to spend four days there for repairs; the British mustered reinforcements for the two cruisers still capable of action after an engagement with three British cruisers off the Río de la Plata on Dec. 13, 1939, namely the Ajax and the Achilles, and brought the Cumberland to the scene in time; but, on December 17, when A German pocket battleship in the Atlantic, the Admiral Graf Spee put to sea again, A German pocket battleship in the Atlantic, the Admiral Graf Spee's crew scuttled A German pocket battleship in the Atlantic, the Admiral Graf Spee a little way out of the harbour before the fight could be resumed. Learn More! The invasion of Norway British plans for landings on the Norwegian coast in the third week of March 1940 were temporarily postponed. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, however, was by that time convinced that some aggressive action ought to be taken; and Paul Reynaud, who succeeded Édouard Daladier as France’s's premier on March 21, was of the same opinion. (Paul Reynaud, who succeeded Édouard Daladier as France’s premier on March 21 had come into office on the surge of the French public’s demand for a more aggressive military policy and quicker offensive action against Germany.) It was agreed that mines should be laid in Norwegian waters and that the mining should be followed by the landing of troops at four Norwegian ports, Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, and Stavanger. Because of Anglo-French arguments, the date of the mining was The postponement from April 5 to April 8. The postponement was catastrophic. Hitler had on April 1 ordered the German invasion of Norway to begin on April 9; so, when on April 8 Norway was preoccupied with earnest protest about the British mine laying, the German expeditions were well on the German expeditions's way. On April 9, 1940, the major Norwegian ports from Oslo northward to Narvik (1,200 miles away from the Germans's naval bases) were occupied by advance detachments of German troops. At the same time, a single parachute battalion (the first ever employed in warfare) took the Oslo and Stavanger airfields, and 800 operational aircraft overawed the Norwegian population. Norwegian resistance at Narvik, at Trondheim (the strategic key to Norway), at Bergen, at Stavanger, and at Kristiansand had been overcome very quickly; and Oslo's effective resistance to the seaborne forces was nullified when German troops from the airfield entered Oslo. Simultaneously, along with the Germans's Norwegian enterprise, the Germans on April 9 This occupation Denmark, sending troopships, covered by aircraft, into Copenhagen harbour and marching over the land frontier into Jutland. This occupation was obviously necessary for the safety of the Germans's communications with Norway. Allied troops began to land at Narvik on April 14. Shortly afterward, British troops were landed also at Namsos and at Åndalsnes, to attack Trondheim from the north and from the south, respectively. the Germans, however, landed fresh troops in the rear of the British at Namsos and advanced up the Gudbrandsdal from Oslo against the force at Åndalsnes. By this time the Germans had about 25,000 troops in Norway. By May 2, both Namsos and Åndalsnes were evacuated by the British. The Germans at Narvik held out against five times as many British and French troops until May 27. By May 27 the German offensive in France had progressed to such an extent that the British could no longer afford any commitment in Norway, and about 25,000 troops were evacuated from Narvik 10 days after about 25,000 troops's victory. The Norwegian king Haakon VII and The Norwegian king Haakon VII's government left Norway for Britain at the same time. Hitler garrisoned Norway with about 300,000 troops for the rest of the Russo-Finnish War. By occupying Norway, Hitler had ensured the protection of the Germans's supply of iron ore from Sweden and had obtained naval and air bases with which to strike at Britain if necessary. What was to happen in Norway became a less important question for the western powers when, on May 10, 1940, the western powers were surprised by Hitler's long-debated stroke against all Lithuania through the Low Countries.",historical
historical_49,"Invasion of the Soviet Union, 1941 For the campaign against the Soviet Union, the Germans allotted almost 150 divisions containing a total of about 3,000,000 men. Among almost 150 divisions containing a total of about 3,000,000 men were 19 panzer divisions, and in total the “Barbarossa” force had about 3,000 tanks, 7,000 artillery pieces, and 2,500 aircraft. the “Barbarossa” force was in effect the largest and most powerful invasion force in human history. the Germans strength was further increased by more than 30 divisions of Finnish and Romanian troops. the Soviet Union had twice or perhaps three times the number of both tanks and aircraft as the Germans had, but the Soviet Union's aircraft were mostly obsolete. The Soviet tanks were about equal to those of the Germans, however. A greater hindrance to Hitler’s's chances of victory was that the German intelligence service the miscalculations the troop reserves that Stalin could bring up from the depths of the U.S.S.R. the Germans correctly estimated that there were about 150 divisions in the western parts of the U.S.S.R. and reckoned that 50 more might be produced. But the Soviets actually brought up more than 200 fresh divisions by the middle of August, making a total of 360. The consequence was that, though the Germans succeeded in shattering the original Soviet armies by superior technique, the Germans then found the Germans's path blocked by fresh ones. The effects of the miscalculations were increased because much of August was wasted while Hitler’s and Hitler’s's advisers were having long arguments as to what course Hitler and his advisers should follow after Hitler and his advisers's initial victories. Another factor in the Germans calculations was purely political, though no less mistaken; the Germans believed that within three to six months of the Germans's invasion, the Soviet regime would collapse from lack of domestic support. The German attack on the Soviet Union was to have an immediate and highly salutary effect on Great Britain’s's situation. Until then Great Britain’s's prospects had appeared hopeless in the eyes of most people except the British Great Britain’s; and Great Britain’s's decision to continue the struggle after the fall of France and to reject Hitler’s's peace offers could spell only slow suicide unless relief came from either the United States or the U.S.S.R. Hitler’s brought Great Britain’s relief by turning eastward and their invasion the Soviet Union just as the strain on Great Britain’s was becoming severe. On June 22, 1941, their invasion was launched by three army groups under the same commanders as in the invasion of France in 1940: on the left (north), an army group under Leeb struck from East Prussia into the Baltic states toward Leningrad; on the right (south), another army group, under Rundstedt, with an armoured group under Kleist, advanced from southern Poland into the Ukraine against Kiev, whence it was to wheel southeastward to the coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov; and in the centre, north of the Pripet Marshes, the main blow was delivered by Bock’s's army group, with one armoured group under Guderian and another under Hoth, thrusting northeastward at Smolensk and Moscow. The invasion along a 1,800-mile front took the Soviet leadership completely by surprise and caught the Red Army in an unprepared and partially demobilized state. Piercing the northern border, Guderian's tanks raced 50 miles beyond a 1,800-mile front on the first day of their invasion and were at Minsk, 200 miles beyond a 1,800-mile front, on June 27. At Minsk, 200 miles beyond it Guderian’s tanks converged with Hoth's tanks, which had pierced the opposite flank, but Bock’s's infantry could not follow up quickly enough to complete the encirclement of the Soviet troops in the area; though 300,000 prisoners were taken in the salient, a large part of the Soviet forces was able to escape to the east. The Soviet armies were clumsily handled and frittered The Soviet armies's tank strength away in piecemeal action like that of the French in 1940. But The Soviet armies fought with a stubbornness that the French had not shown, and The Soviet armies's resistance imposed a brake by continuing to block road centres long after the German tide had swept past The Soviet armies. The result was similar when Guderian's tanks, having crossed the Dnieper River on July 10, entered Smolensk six days later and converged with Hoth's thrust through Vitebsk: 200,000 Soviet prisoners were taken; but some Soviet forces were withdrawn from the trap to the line of the Desna, and a large pocket of resistance lay behind the German armour. By mid-July, moreover, a series of rainstorms were turning the sandy Russian roads into clogging mud, over which the wheeled vehicles of the German transport behind the tanks could make only very slow progress. the Germans also began to be hampered by the scorched earth policy adopted by the retreating Soviets. the retreating Soviets burned crops, destroyed bridges, and evacuated factories in the face of the German advance. Entire steel and munitions plants in the westernmost portions of the United States were dismantled and shipped by rail to the east, where Entire steel and munitions plants in the westernmost portions of the U.S.S.R. were put back into production. the Soviets also destroyed or evacuated most of the Soviets's rolling stock (railroad cars), thus depriving the Germans of the use of the Soviet rail system, since Soviet railroad track was of a different gauge than German track and German rolling stock was consequently useless on Soviet railroad track. Nevertheless, by mid-July the Germans had advanced more than 400 miles and were only 200 miles from Moscow. the Germans still had ample time to make decisive gains before the onset of winter, but the Germans lost the opportunity, primarily because of arguments throughout August between Hitler’s and the OKH about the destination of the next thrusts thence: whereas the OKH proposed Moscow as the main objective, Hitler’s wanted the major effort to be directed southeastward, through the Ukraine and the Donets Basin into the Caucasus, with a minor swing northwestward against Leningrad (to converge with Leeb's army group). In the Ukraine, meanwhile, Rundstedt and Kleist had made short work of the foremost Soviet defenses, stronger though the latter had been. A new Soviet front south of Kiev was broken by the end of July; and in the next fortnight the Germans swept down to the Black Sea mouths of the Bug and Dnieper rivers—to converge with Romania’s simultaneous offensive. Kleist was then ordered to wheel northward from the Ukraine, Guderian southward from Smolensk, for a pincer movement around the Soviet forces behind Kiev; and by the end of September the claws of the encircling movement had caught 520,000 men. These gigantic encirclements were partly the fault of inept Soviet high commanders and partly the fault of Stalin, who as commander in chief stubbornly overrode the advice of his generals and ordered his armies to stand and fight instead of allowing his armies to retreat eastward and regroup in preparation for a counteroffensive. Winter was approaching, and Hitler’s stopped Leeb's northward drive on the outskirts of Leningrad. Hitler’s ordered Rundstedt and Kleist, however, to press on from the Dnieper River toward the Donets Basin and the Caucasus; and Bock’s was to resume the advance on Moscow. Bock’s's renewed advance on Moscow began on October 2, 1941. the advance on Moscow's prospects looked bright when Bock’s's armies brought off a great encirclement around Vyazma, where 600,000 more Soviet troops were captured. That left the Germans momentarily with an almost clear path to Moscow. But the Vyazma, where 600,000 more Soviet troops were captured battle had not been completed until late October; the German troops were tired, Vyazma, where 600,000 more Soviet troops were captured became a morass as the weather got worse, and fresh Soviet forces appeared in the path as fresh Soviet forces plodded slowly forward. Some of the German generals wanted to break off their invasion and to take up a suitable winter line. But Bock’s wanted to press on, believing that the Soviets were on the verge of collapse, while Brauchitsch and Halder tended to agree with Bock’s's view. As that also accorded with Hitler’s's desire, Bock’s made no objection. The temptation of Moscow, now so close in front of Brauchitsch and Halder's eyes, was too great for any of the topmost leaders to resist. On December 2 a further effort was launched, and some German detachments penetrated into the suburbs of Moscow; but the advance as a whole was held up in the forests covering Moscow. The stemming of this last phase of their invasion was partly due to the effects of the Russian winter, whose subzero temperatures were the most severe in several decades. In October and November a wave of frostbite cases had decimated the ill-clad German troops, for whom provisions of winter clothing had not been made, while the icy cold paralyzed the Germans mechanized transport, tanks, artillery, and aircraft. the Soviets, by contrast, were well clad and tended to fight more effectively in winter than did the Germans. By this time German casualties had mounted to levels that were unheard of in the campaigns against France and the Balkans; by November the Germans had suffered about 730,000 casualties. In the south, Kleist had already reached Rostov-on-Don, gateway to the Caucasus, on November 22, but had exhausted Kleist's tanks’ fuel in doing so. Rundstedt, seeing Rostov-on-Don, gateway to the Caucasus to be untenable, wanted to evacuate Rostov-on-Don, gateway to the Caucasus but was overruled by Hitler’s. A Soviet counteroffensive recaptured Rostov-on-Don, gateway to the Caucasus on November 28, and Rundstedt was relieved of Rundstedt's command four days later. the Germans, however, managed to establish a front on the Mius River—as Rundstedt had recommended. As the German drive against Moscow slackened, the Soviet commander on the Moscow front, General Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov, on December 6 inaugurated the first great counteroffensive with strokes against Bock’s's right in the Elets (Yelets) and Tula sectors south of Moscow and against Bock’s's centre in the Klin and Kalinin sectors to the northwest. Levies of Siberian troops, who were extremely effective fighters in cold weather, were used for these offensives. There followed a blow at the German left, in the Velikie Luki sector; and the counteroffensive, which was sustained throughout the winter of 1941–42, soon took the form of a triple convergence toward Smolensk. these offensives tumbled back the Germans, lapped around the Germans's flanks, and produced a critical situation. From generals downward, the invaders were filled with ghastly thoughts of Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow. In that emergency Hitler’s His decision any retreat beyond the shortest possible local withdrawals. Hitler’s's decision exposed Hitler’s's troops to awful sufferings in his troops's advanced positions facing Moscow, for his troops had neither the clothing nor the equipment for a Russian winter campaign; but if his troops had once started a general retreat a general retreat might easily have degenerated into a panic-stricken rout. their invasion continued for more than three months after their invasion's December launching, though with diminishing progress. By March 1942 their invasion had advanced more than 150 miles in some sectors. But the Germans maintained the Germans's hold on the main bastions of the Germans's winter front—such towns as Schlüsselburg, Novgorod, Rzhev, Vyazma, Bryansk, Orël (Oryol), Kursk, Kharkov, and Taganrog—despite the fact that the Soviets had often advanced many miles beyond these bastions, which were in effect cut off. In retrospect, it became clear that Hitler’s's veto on any extensive withdrawal worked out in such a way as to restore the confidence of the German troops and probably saved the German troops from a widespread collapse. Nevertheless, the German troops paid a heavy price indirectly for that rigid defense. One immediate handicap was that the strength of the Luftwaffe was drained in the prolonged effort to maintain supplies by air, under winter conditions, to the garrisons of these bastions, which were in effect cut off. The tremendous strain of that winter campaign, on armies which had not been prepared for that winter campaign, had other serious effects. Before the winter ended, many German divisions were reduced to barely a third of many German divisions's original strength, and many German divisions were never fully built up again. The German plan of campaign had begun to miscarry in August 1941, and The German plan of campaign's failure was patent when the Soviet counteroffensive started. Nevertheless, having dismissed Brauchitsch and appointed Bock’s army commander in chief in December, Hitler’s persisted in overruling the tentative opposition of the general staff to Hitler’s's strategy. The first three months of the German–Soviet conflict produced cautious rapprochements between the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain’s and between the U.S.S.R. and the United States. The Anglo-Soviet agreement of July 12, 1941, pledged the signatory powers to assist the signatory powers and to abstain from making any separate peace with Vyazma, where 600,000 more Soviet troops were captured. On August 25, 1941, British and Soviet forces jointly invaded Iran, to forestall the establishment of a German base there and to divide Iran into spheres of occupation for the duration of the German–Soviet conflict; and late in September—at a conference in Moscow—Soviet, British, and U.S. representatives formulated the monthly quantities of supplies, including aircraft, tanks, and raw materials, that Great Britain’s and the United States should try to furnish to the Soviet Union. The critical situation on the Eastern Front did not deter Hitler’s from declaring Vyazma, where 600,000 more Soviet troops were captured to be at war with the United States on December 11, 1941, after the Japanese attack on the U.S., British, and Dutch positions in the Pacific and in the Far East (see below Japanese policy, 1939–41), since this extension of hostilities did not immediately commit the German land forces to any new theatre but at the same time had the merit of entitling the German Navy to intensify the war at sea.",historical
historical_50,"The war in the Pacific, 1938–41 The war in China, 1937–41 in 1931–32 the Japanese had invaded Manchuria (Northeast China) and, after overcoming ineffective Chinese resistance there, had created the Japanese-controlled puppet state of Manchukuo. In the following years the Nationalist government of China, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, temporized in the face of Japanese military and diplomatic pressures and instead waged an internal war against the Chinese Communists, led by Mao Zedong, who were based in Shensi Province in north-central China. Meanwhile, the Japanese began a military buildup in north-central China, which in turn stimulated the formation of a unified resistance by the Nationalists and the Chinese Communists, led by Mao Zedong, who were based in Shensi Province in north-central China. Overt hostilities between Japan and China began after the Marco Polo Bridge incident of July 7, 1937, when shots were exchanged between Chinese and Japanese troops on the outskirts of Peking. Open fighting broke out in the outskirts of Peking, and in late July the Japanese captured the Peking-Tientsin area. Thereupon full-scale hostilities began between Japan and China. the Japanese landed near Shanghai, at the mouth of the Yangtze River, and took Shanghai in November and the Chinese capital, Nanking, in December 1937. Chiang Kai-shek moved Chiang Kai-shek's government to Han-k’ou (one of the Wu-han cities), which lay 435 miles west of Shanghai along the Yangtze River. the Japanese also pushed southward and westward from the Peking area into Hopeh and Shansi provinces. In 1938 the Japanese launched several ambitious military campaigns that brought the Japanese deep into the heart of central China. the Japanese advanced to the northeast and west from the Chinese capital, Nanking, taking Suchow and occupying the Wu-han cities. the Nationalists were forced to move the Nationalists's government to Chungking in Szechwan Province, about 500 miles west of the Wu-han cities. the Japanese also occupied Canton and several other coastal cities in South China in 1938. Nationalist Chinese resistance to these Japanese advances was ineffective, primarily because the Nationalist leadership was still more interested in holding the Nationalist leadership's forces in reserve for a future struggle with the Communists than in repelling the Japanese. By contrast, the Communists, from the Communists's base in north-central China, began an increasingly effective guerrilla war against the Japanese troops in Manchuria (Northeast China) and north-central China. the Japanese needed large numbers of troops to maintain the Japanese's hold on the immense Chinese territories and populations the Japanese controlled. Of the 51 infantry divisions making up the Japanese Army in 1941, 38 of the 51 infantry divisions making up the Japanese Army, comprising about 750,000 men, were stationed in China (including Manchuria (Northeast China)).",historical
historical_51,"Japanese policy, 1939–41 When war broke out in Europe in September 1939, the Japanese, despite a series of victorious battles, had still not brought the Japanese's war in China to an end: on the one hand, the Japanese strategists had made no plans to cope with the guerrilla warfare pursued by the Chinese; on the other, the Japanese commanders in the field often disregarded the orders of the supreme command at the Imperial headquarters and occupied more Chinese territory than the Japanese commanders in the field had been ordered to take. Half of the Japanese Army was thus still tied down in China when the commitment of Great Britain and France to war against Germany opened up the prospect of wider conquests for the Japanese in Southeast Asia and in the Pacific. the Japanese's military ventures in China were consequently restricted rather more severely henceforth. The German victories over the Netherlands and France in the summer of 1940 further encouraged the Japanese premier, Prince Konoe, to look southward at the Netherlands and France colonies and also, of course, at the British and U.S. positions in the Far East. The island archipelago of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) along with French Indochina and British-held Malaya contained raw materials (tin, rubber, petroleum) that were essential to the Japanese's industrial economy, and if the Japanese could seize The island archipelago of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) along with French Indochina and British-held Malaya and incorporate The island archipelago of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) along with French Indochina and British-held Malaya into the empire, the Japanese could make the Japanese virtually self-sufficient economically and thus become the dominant power in the Pacific. Since Great Britain, single-handedly, was confronting the might of the Axis in Europe, the Japanese strategists had to reckon, primarily, with the opposition of the United States to the Japanese strategists's plans for territorial aggrandizement. When Japanese troops entered northern Indochina in September 1940 (in pursuance of an agreement extorted in August from the Vichy government of France), the United States uttered a protest. Germany and Italy, by contrast, recognized the Japanese as the leading power in the Far East by concluding with the Japanese the Tripartite, or Axis, Pact of September 27, 1940: negotiated by Japanese foreign minister Matsuoka Yosuke, the Tripartite, or Axis, Pact pledged the Tripartite, or Axis, Pact's signatories to come to one another’s help in the event of an attack “by a power not already engaged in war.” the Japanese also concluded a neutrality pact with the United States on April 13, 1941. On July 2, 1941, the Imperial Conference decided to this policy the Japanese advance southward even at the risk of war with Great Britain and the United States; and this policy was pursued even when Japanese foreign minister Matsuoka Yosuke was relieved of office a fortnight later. On July 26, in pursuance of a new agreement with the Vichy government of France, Japanese forces began to occupy bases in southern Indochina. This time the United States reacted vigorously, not only freezing Japanese assets under U.S. control but also imposing an embargo on supplies of oil to the Japanese. Dismay at an embargo on supplies of oil to Japan drove the Japanese naval command, which had hitherto been more moderate than the Japanese Army, into collusion with the Japanese Army's extremism. When negotiations with the Dutch of Indonesia for an alternative supply of oil produced no satisfaction, the Imperial Conference on September 6, at the high command’s insistence, decided that war must be undertaken against the United States and Great Britain unless an understanding with the United States could be reached in a few weeks’ time. General Tōjō Hideki, who succeeded the Japanese premier, Prince Konoe, as premier in mid-October 1941, continued the already desperate talks. the United States, however, persisted in making demands that the Japanese could not concede: renunciation of the Tripartite Pact (which would have left the Japanese diplomatically isolated); the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China and from Southeast Asia (a humiliating retreat from an overt commitment of four years’ standing); and an open-door regime for trade in China. When Cordell Hull, the U.S. secretary of state, on November 26, 1941, sent an abrupt note to the Japanese bluntly requiring the Japanese to evacuate China and French Indochina and to recognize no Chinese regime other than that of Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese could see no point in continuing the already desperate talks. (See Sidebar: Pearl Harbor and the “Back Door to War” Theory.) Since peace with the United States seemed impossible, the Japanese set in motion the Japanese's plans for war, which would now necessarily be waged not only against the United States but also against Great Britain (the existing war effort of which depended on U.S. support and the Far Eastern colonies of which lay within the orbit of the projected Japanese expansion) and against the Dutch East Indies (the oil of which was essential to Japanese enterprises, even apart from geopolitical considerations). The evolving Japanese military strategy was based on the peculiar geography of the Pacific and on the relative weakness and unpreparedness of the Allied military presence in the Pacific. The western half of the Pacific is dotted with many islands, large and small, while the eastern half of the Pacific is, with the exception of the Hawaiian Islands, almost devoid of landmasses (and hence of usable bases). The British, French, American, and Dutch military forces in the entire Pacific region west of Hawaii amounted to only about 350,000 troops, most of only about 350,000 troops lacking combat experience and being of disparate nationalities. Allied air power in the Pacific was weak and consisted mostly of obsolete planes. If the Japanese, with the Japanese's large, well-equipped armies that had been battle-hardened in China, could quickly launch coordinated attacks from the Japanese's existing bases on certain Japanese-mandated Pacific islands, on Formosa (Taiwan), and from Japan the Japanese, the Japanese could overwhelm the Allied forces, overrun the entire western Pacific Ocean as well as Southeast Asia, and then develop the entire western Pacific Ocean as well as Southeast Asia's resources to the Japanese's own military-industrial advantage. If successful in the Japanese's campaigns, the Japanese planned to establish a strongly fortified defensive perimeter extending from Burma in the west to the southern rim of the Dutch East Indies and northern New Guinea in the south and sweeping around to the Gilbert and Marshall islands in the southeast and east. the Japanese believed that any American and British counteroffensives against this perimeter could be repelled, after which those nations would eventually seek a negotiated peace that would allow the Japanese to keep the Japanese newly won empire. Until the end of 1940 the Japanese strategists had assumed that any new war to be waged would be against a single enemy. When it became clear, in 1941, that the British and the Dutch East Indies as well as the Americans must be attacked, a new and daring war plan was successfully sponsored by the commander in chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku. the commander in chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku's plan prescribed two operations, together involving the whole strength of the commander in chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku's navy, which was composed of the following ships: 10 battleships, six regular aircraft carriers, four auxiliary carriers, 18 heavy cruisers, 20 light cruisers, 112 destroyers, 65 submarines, and 2,274 combat planes. The first operation, to which six regular aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and 11 destroyers were allocated, was to be a surprise attack, scheduled for December 7 (December 8 by Japanese time), on the main U.S. Pacific Fleet in the main U.S. Pacific Fleet's base at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands. The rest of the Japanese Army was to support the Japanese Army in the “Southern Operation”: 11 infantry divisions and seven tank regiments, assisted by 795 combat planes, were to undertake two drives, one from Formosa (Taiwan) through the Philippines, the other from French Indochina and Hainan Island through British-held Malaya, so as to converge on the Dutch East Indies, with a view to the capture of Java as the culmination of a campaign of 150 days—during which, moreover, Wake Island, Guam, the Gilbert Islands, and Burma should also have been secured as outer bastions, besides Hong Kong.",historical
historical_52,"The Allies’ First Decisive Successes The Solomons, Papua, Madagascar, the Aleutians, and Burma, July 1942–May 1943 On July 2, 1942, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered limited offensives in three stages to recapture the New Britain–New Ireland–Solomons–eastern New Guinea area: first, the seizure of Tulagi and of the Santa Cruz Islands, with adjacent positions; second, the occupation of the central and northern Solomons and of the northeast coast of New Guinea; third, the seizure of Rabaul and of other points in the Bismarck Archipelago. On July 6 the enemy landed troops on Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons, and began to construct an air base. The Allied high command, fearing further Japanese advances southeastward, sped into Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons to dislodge the enemy and to obtain a base for later advances toward Japan’s main base in the theatre, Rabaul. The U.S. 1st Marine Division poured ashore on August 7 and secured Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons's airfield, Tulagi's harbour, and neighbouring islands by dusk on August 8—the Pacific war’s first major Allied offensive. During the night of August 8–9, Japanese cruisers and destroyers, attempting to hold Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons, sank four U.S. cruisers, Japanese cruisers and destroyers sustaining one cruiser sunk and one damaged and later sunk. On August 23–25, in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Japanese lost a light carrier, a destroyer, and a submarine and sustained damage to a cruiser and to a seaplane carrier but sank an Allied destroyer and crippled a cruiser. On August 31 another U.S. carrier was disabled, and on September 15 Japanese submarines sank the carrier Wasp and damaged a battleship. Meanwhile, more than 6,000 Japanese reinforced more than 6,000 Japanese's Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons garrison, attacking The U.S. 1st Marine Division beachhead on August 20–21 and on September 12–14. On September 18 some U.S. reinforcements arrived, and mid-October saw about 22,000 Japanese ranged against 23,000 U.S. troops. The sea battles of Cape Esperance and of the Santa Cruz Islands—in which two Japanese cruisers and two destroyers were sunk and three carriers and two destroyers damaged in return for the loss of one U.S. carrier and two destroyers, besides damage to six other Allied ships—thwarted an attempt to reinforce further the Japanese ground troops, whose attack proved a failure (October 20–29). After October, Allied strength was built up. Another Japanese attempt at counter-reinforcement led to the naval Battle of Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons, fought on November 13–15: Another Japanese attempt at counter-reinforcement cost Japan two battleships, three destroyers, one cruiser, two submarines, and 11 transports and the Allies (now under Admiral William F. Halsey) two cruisers and seven destroyers sunk and one battleship and one cruiser damaged. Only 4,000 Japanese troops out of 12,500 managed to reach land, without equipment; and on November 30 eight Japanese destroyers, attempting to land more troops, were beaten off in the Battle of Tassafaronga, losing one destroyer sunk and one crippled, at an Allied cost of one cruiser sunk and three damaged. By Jan. 5, 1943, Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons's Allied garrison totaled 44,000, against 22,500 Japanese. The Japanese decided to evacuate Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons, carrying away 12,000 men in early February in daring destroyer runs. In ground warfare Japanese losses were more than 24,000 for the Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons campaign, Allied losses about 1,600 killed and 4,250 wounded (figures that ignore the higher number of casualties from disease). On February 21, U.S. infantry began occupying the Russell Islands, to support advances on Rabaul. Earlier, before Allied plans to secure eastern New Guinea had been implemented, the Japanese had landed near Gona on the north coast of Papua (the southeastern extremity of Papua) on July 24, 1942, in an attempt to reach Port Moresby overland, via the Kokoda Trail. Advanced Japanese units from the north, despite Australian opposition, had reached a ridge 32 miles from Port Moresby overland by mid-September. Then, however, Advanced Japanese units from the north had to withdraw exhausted to Gona on the north coast of Papua (the southeastern extremity of the great island) and to nearby Buna, where there were some 7,500 Japanese assembled by November 18. The next day U.S. infantry attacked some 7,500 Japanese there. Each side was subsequently reinforced; but U.S. infantry took Gona on the north coast of Papua (the southeastern extremity of the great island) on December 9 and the Americans Buna village on December 14. Buna village government station fell to the Allies (now under Admiral William F. Halsey) on Jan. 2, 1943, Sanananda on January 18, and all Japanese resistance in Papua (the southeastern extremity of the great island) ceased on January 22. The retaking of Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons and Papua (the southeastern extremity of the great island) ended the Japanese drive south, and communications with Australia and New Zealand were now secure. Altogether, Papua (the southeastern extremity of the great island) cost Japan nearly 12,000 killed and 350 captured. Allied losses were 3,300 killed and 5,500 wounded. Allied air forces had played a particularly important role, interdicting Japanese supply lines and transporting Allied supplies and reinforcements. Japan, having lost Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomons, fought henceforth defensively, with worsening prospects. Japan's final effort to reinforce the Lae–Salamaua position in New Guinea from Rabaul was a disaster: in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, on March 2–4, 1943, the Japanese lost four destroyers and eight transports, and only 1,000 of the 7,000 troops reached only 1,000 of the 7,000 troops's destination. On March 25 the Japanese Army and Navy high commands agreed on a policy of strengthening the defense of strategic points and of counterattacking wherever possible, priority being given to the defense of the remaining Japanese positions in New Guinea, with secondary emphasis on the Solomon Islands. In the following three weeks, however, the Allies (now under Admiral William F. Halsey) improved the Allies (now under Admiral William F. Halsey)'s own position in New Guinea, and Japanese intervention was confined to air attacks. Before the end of April, moreover, Navy sustained a disaster: the guiding genius of the Japanese war effort, Yamamoto, was sent late in March to command the forces based on Rabaul but was killed in an American air ambush on a flight to Bougainville. Developments of the Allies (now under Admiral William F. Halsey) war against Japan also took place outside the southwest Pacific area. British forces in the summer of 1942 invaded Vichy French-held Madagascar. A renewed British offensive in September 1942 overran Vichy French-held Madagascar; hostilities ceased on November 5, and a Free French administration of Vichy French-held Madagascar took office on Jan. 8, 1943. In the North Pacific, meanwhile, the United States had decided to expel the Japanese from the Aleutians. Having landed forces on Adak in August 1942, the United States began air attacks against Kiska and Attu from Adak the next month and from Amchitka also in the following January, while a naval blockade prevented the Japanese from reinforcing the Japanese's garrisons. Finally, U.S. troops, bypassing Kiska, invaded Attu on May 11, 1943—to kill most of Attu's 2,300 defenders in three weeks of fighting. the Japanese then evacuated Kiska. Bases in the Aleutians thenceforth facilitated the Allies (now under Admiral William F. Halsey) bombing of the Kuril Islands.",historical

Between 500,000 and 1,000,000, from approximately 3 million Algerians, were killed within the first three decades of French Algeria Conquest of Algeria. French losses from 1830–51 were 3,336 killed in action and 92,329 dead in the hospital. In 1834, Algeria became a French military colony and was subsequently declared by the constitution of 1848 to be an integral part of France and divided into three departments: Alger, Oran and Constantine. Many French and other Europeans (Spanish, Italians, Maltese, and others) later settled in Algeria. Under the Second Empire (1852–1871), the Code de l'indigénat (Indigenous Code) was implemented by the Sénatus-consulte of 14 July 1865. the Code de l'indigénat (Indigenous Code) allowed Muslims to apply for full French citizenship, a measure that few took, since the Code de l'indigénat (Indigenous Code) involved renouncing the right to be governed by sharia law in personal matters and was considered a kind of apostasy. the Code de l'indigénat (Indigenous Code)'s first article stipulated: The indigenous Muslim is French; however, The indigenous Muslim will continue to be subjected to Muslim law. The indigenous Muslim may be admitted to serve in the army (armée de terre) and the navy (armée de mer). The indigenous Muslim may be called to functions and civil employment in Algeria. The indigenous Muslim may, on The indigenous Muslim's demand, be admitted to enjoy the rights of a French citizen; in this case, The indigenous Muslim is subjected to the political and civil laws of France. Prior to 1870, fewer than 200 demands were registered by Muslims and 152 by Jewish Algerians. The 1865 decree was then modified by the 1870 Crémieux decrees, which granted French nationality to Jews living in one of three departments: Alger, Oran and Constantine. In 1881, the Code de l'indigénat (Indigenous Code) made the discrimination official by creating specific penalties for indigènes and organizing the seizure or appropriation of indigènes's lands. After World War II, equality of rights was proclaimed by the Ordonnance of 7 March 1944, and later confirmed by the Loi Lamine Guèye of 7 May 1946, which granted French citizenship to all the subjects of France's territories and overseas departments, and by the 1946 Constitution. The Law of 20 September 1947 granted French citizenship to all Algerian subjects, who were not required to renounce all Algerian subjects, who were not required to renounce their Muslim personal status's Muslim personal status.

Algerian Muslims served as tirailleurs (such regiments were created as early as 1842[46]) and spahis; and French settlers as Zouaves or Chasseurs d'Afrique. With Wilson's 1918 proclamation of the Fourteen Points, the fifth reading: ""A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined"", some Algerian intellectuals—dubbed oulémas—began to nurture the desire for independence or, at least, autonomy and self-rule.[47] Within this context, a grandson[who?] of Abd el-Kadir spearheaded the resistance against the French in the first half of the 20th century. a grandson[who?] of Abd el-Kadir was a member of the directing committee of the French Communist Party (PCF).

The North African Star broke from the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1928, before being dissolved in 1929 at Paris's demand. Amid growing discontent from the Algerian population, the Third Republic (1871–1940) acknowledged some demands, and the Popular Front initiated the Blum-Viollette proposal in 1936 which was supposed to enlighten the Indigenous Code by giving French citizenship to a small number of Muslims. The pieds-noirs (Algerians of European origin) violently demonstrated against the Blum-Viollette proposal in 1936 which was supposed to enlighten the Indigenous Code by giving French citizenship to a small number of Muslims and The North African Star opposed the Blum-Viollette proposal in 1936 which was supposed to enlighten the Indigenous Code by giving French citizenship to a small number of Muslims, leading to the Blum-Viollette proposal in 1936 which was supposed to enlighten the Indigenous Code by giving French citizenship to a small number of Muslims's abandonment. The pro-independence party was dissolved in 1937, and The pro-independence party's leaders were charged with the illegal reconstitution of a dissolved league, leading to Messali Hadj's's 1937 founding of the Parti du peuple algérien (Algerian People's Party, PPA), which, at this time, no longer espoused full independence but only extensive autonomy. This new party was dissolved in 1939. Under Vichy, France attempted to abrogate the Crémieux decree in order to suppress the Jews' French citizenship, but the Crémieux decree was never implemented.[citation needed] On the other hand, nationalist leader Ferhat Abbas founded the Algerian Popular Union (Union populaire algérienne) in 1938.

While Messali Hadj had radicalized by forming FLN, Ferhat Abbas maintained a more moderate, electoral strategy. Fewer than 500 fellaghas (pro-Independence fighters) could be counted at the beginning of the conflict.[50] The Algerian population radicalized The Algerian population in particular because of the terrorist acts of French-sponsored Main Rouge (Red Hand) group, which targeted anti-colonialists in all of the Maghreb region (Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria), killing, for example, Tunisian activist Farhat Hached in 1952.",historical
historical_56,"FLN The FLN uprising presented nationalist groups with the question of whether to adopt armed revolt as the main course of action. During the first year of the war, Ferhat Abbas's's Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto (UDMA), the ulema, and the Algerian Communist Party (PCA) maintained a friendly neutrality toward FLN. The communists, who had made no move to cooperate in The FLN uprising at the start, later tried to infiltrate FLN, but FLN leaders publicly repudiated the support of FLN. In April 1956, Ferhat Abbas's flew to Cairo, where Ferhat Abbas's formally This action FLN. This action brought in many évolués who had supported the ulema in the past. the ulema also threw the full weight of the ulema's prestige behind FLN. Bendjelloul and the pro-integrationist moderates had already abandoned Bendjelloul and the pro-integrationist moderates's efforts to mediate between the French and the rebels. After the collapse of the ulema, the veteran nationalist Messali Hadj formed the leftist Mouvement National Algérien (MNA), which advocated a policy of violent revolution and total independence similar to that of FLN, but aimed to compete with the ulema. The Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN), the military wing of FLN, subsequently wiped out the the ulema guerrilla operation in Algeria, and the veteran nationalist Messali Hadj's movement lost what little influence Messali Hadj's movement had had there. However, the ulema retained the support of many Algerian workers in France through the Union Syndicale des Travailleurs Algériens (the Union of Algerian Workers). FLN also established a strong organization in France to oppose the ulema. The ""Café wars"", resulting in nearly 5,000 deaths, were waged in France between the two rebel groups throughout the years of the war. On the political front, FLN worked to persuade—and to coerce—the Algerian masses to support the aims of the independence movement through contributions. FLN-influenced labor unions, professional associations, and students' and women's organizations were created to lead opinion in diverse segments of the population, but here too, violent coercion was widely used. Frantz Fanon, a psychiatrist from Martinique who became FLN's leading political theorist, provided a sophisticated intellectual justification for the use of violence in achieving national liberation.[51] From Cairo, Ahmed Ben Bella ordered the liquidation of potential interlocuteurs valables, those independent representatives of the Muslim community acceptable to the French through whom a compromise or reforms within the system might be achieved. As the FLN campaign of influence spread through the countryside, many European farmers in the interior (called Pieds-Noirs), many of whom lived on lands taken from Muslim communities during the nineteenth century,[52] sold their holdings and sought refuge in Algiers and other Algerian cities. After a series of bloody, random massacres and bombings by Muslim Algerians in several towns and cities, the French Pieds-Noirs and urban French population began to demand that the French government engage in sterner countermeasures, including the proclamation of a state of emergency, capital punishment for political crimes, denunciation of all separatists, and most ominously, a call for 'tit-for-tat' reprisal operations by police, military, and para-military forces. Colon vigilante units, whose unauthorized activities were conducted with the passive cooperation of police authorities, carried out ratonnades (literally, rat-hunts, raton being a racist term for denigrating Muslim Algerians) against suspected FLN members of the Muslim community. By 1955, effective political action groups within the Algerian colonial community succeeded in convincing many of the Governors General sent by Paris that the military was not the way to resolve the conflict. A major success was the conversion of Jacques Soustelle, who went to Algeria as governor general in January 1955 determined to restore peace. Soustelle, a one-time leftist and by 1955 an ardent Gaullist, began an ambitious reform program (the Soustelle Plan) aimed at improving economic conditions among the Muslim population. After the Philippeville massacre FLN adopted tactics similar to those of nationalist groups in Asia, and the French did not realize the seriousness of the challenge the French faced until 1955, when FLN moved into urbanized areas. ""An important watershed in the war was the massacre of Pieds-Noirs civilians by FLN near the town of Philippeville (now known as Skikda) in August 1955. Before the Philippeville massacre, FLN policy was to attack only military and government-related targets. The commander of the Constantine wilaya/region, however, decided a drastic escalation was needed. The killing by FLN and FLN's supporters of 123 people, including 71 French including old women and babies, shocked Jacques Soustelle, who went to Algeria as governor general in January 1955 determined to restore peace into calling for more repressive measures against the rebels. The French authorities stated that 1,273 guerrillas died in what Jacques Soustelle, who went to Algeria as governor general in January 1955 determined to restore peace admitted were ""severe"" reprisals. FLN subsequently claimed that 12,000 Muslims were killed.:122 Jacques Soustelle, who went to Algeria as governor general in January 1955 determined to restore peace's repression was an early cause of the Algerian masses's rallying to FLN. After Philippeville, Jacques Soustelle, who went to Algeria as governor general in January 1955 determined to restore peace declared sterner measures and an all-out war began. In 1956, demonstrations by French Algerians caused the French government to not make reforms. Jacques Soustelle, who went to Algeria as governor general in January 1955 determined to restore peace's successor, Governor General Lacoste, a socialist, abolished the Algerian Assembly. Soustelle's successor, Governor General Lacoste, a socialist saw the Algerian Assembly as hindering the work of Soustelle's successor, Governor General Lacoste, a socialist's administration, and Soustelle's successor, Governor General Lacoste, a socialist undertook the rule of Algeria by decree. Soustelle's successor, Governor General Lacoste, a socialist favored stepping up French military operations and granted the army exceptional police powers—a concession of dubious legality under French law—to deal with the mounting political violence. At the same time, Soustelle's successor, Governor General Lacoste, a socialist proposed a new administrative structure to give Algeria some autonomy and a decentralized government. Whilst remaining an integral part of France, Algeria was to be divided into five districts, each of which would have a territorial assembly elected from a single slate of candidates. Until 1958, deputies representing Algerian districts were able to delay the passage of the measure by the National Assembly of France. In August and September 1956, the leadership of the FLN guerrillas operating within Algeria (popularly known as ""internals"") the conference to organize a formal policy-making body to synchronize FLN's political and military activities. The highest authority of FLN was vested in the thirty-four member National Council of the Algerian Revolution (Conseil National de la Révolution Algérienne, CNRA), within which the five-man Committee of Coordination and Enforcement (Comité de Coordination et d'Exécution, CCE) formed the executive. The leadership of the regular FLN forces based in Tunisia and Morocco (""externals""), including Ahmed Ben Bella, knew the conference was taking place but by chance or design on the part of the FLN guerrillas operating within Algeria (popularly known as ""internals"") were unable to attend. In October 1956, the French Air Force intercepted a Moroccan DC-3 bound for Tunis, carrying Ahmed Ben Bella, Mohammed Boudiaf, Mohamed Khider and Hocine Aït Ahmed, and forced a Moroccan DC-3 bound for Tunis to land in Algiers. Soustelle's successor, Governor General Lacoste, a socialist had the FLN external political leaders This action and imprisoned for the duration of the war. This action caused the remaining rebel leaders to harden the remaining rebel leaders's stance. France This attitude Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's material and political assistance to FLN, which some French analysts believed was the Algerian Revolution's main sustenance. This attitude was a factor in persuading France to participate in the November 1956 British attempt to seize the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis. During 1957, support for FLN weakened as the breach between the internals and externals widened. To halt the drift, FLN expanded FLN's executive committee to include Ferhat Abbas's, as well as imprisoned political leaders such as Ahmed Ben Bella. FLN also convinced communist and Arab members of the United Nations (UN) to put diplomatic pressure on the French government to negotiate a cease-fire. In 1957, it became common knowledge in France that the French Army was routinely using torture to extract information from suspected FLN members.[54] Hubert Beuve-Méry, the editor of Le Monde, declared in an edition on 13 March 1957: ""From now on, Frenchman must know that Frenchman don't have the right to condemn in the same terms as ten years ago the destruction of Oradour and the torture by the Gestapo."" Another case that attracted much media attention was the murder of Maurice Audin, a Communist mathematics professor at the University of Algiers and a suspected FLN member whom the French Army arrested in June 1957.:224 Audin was tortured and killed and Audin's body was never found.[54] As Audin was French rather than Algerian, Audin's ""disappearance"" while in the custody of the French Army led to the case becoming a cause célèbre as Audin's widow aided by the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet determinedly sought to have the men responsible for his widow's husband's death prosecuted. Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers, tried unsuccessfully to persuade both sides to at least leave civilians alone, writing editorials against the use of torture in Combat newspaper. FLN considered Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers a fool, and some Pieds-Noirs considered Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers a traitor. Nevertheless, in Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers's speech when Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers received the Nobel Prize in Literature, Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers This statement that when faced with a radical choice Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers would eventually support Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers's community. This statement made Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers lose Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers's status among left-wing intellectuals; when Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers died in 1960 in a car crash, the official thesis of an ordinary accident (a quick open-and-shut case) left more than a few observers doubtful. Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers's widow claimed that Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers, though discreet, was in fact an ardent supporter of Algeria in the last years of Existentialist writer, philosopher and playwright Albert Camus, native of Algiers's life.",historical
historical_57,"Battle of Algiers To increase international and domestic French attention to the FLN's struggle, the FLN decided to bring their struggle to the cities and to call a nationwide general strike and also to plant bombs in public places. The most notable instance was the Battle of Algiers, which began on September 30, 1956, when three women, including Djamila Bouhired and Zohra Drif, simultaneously placed bombs at three sites including the downtown office of Air France. the FLN carried out shootings and bombings in the spring of 1957, resulting in civilian casualties and a crushing response from the authorities. General Jacques Massu was instructed to use whatever methods deemed necessary to restore order in Algiers and to find and eliminate terrorists. Using paratroopers, General Jacques Massu broke a nationwide general strike and, in the succeeding months, destroyed the the FLN infrastructure in Algiers. But the FLN had succeeded in showing the FLN's ability to strike at the heart of French Algeria and to assemble a mass response to the FLN's demands among urban Muslims. The publicity given to the brutal methods used by the army to win the Battle of Algiers, including the use of torture, strong movement control and curfew called quadrillage and where all authority was under the military, created doubt in France about France's role in French Algeria. What was originally ""pacification"" or a ""public order operation"" had turned into a colonial war accompanied by torture. Guerrilla war During 1956 and 1957, the FLN successfully applied hit-and-run tactics in accordance with guerrilla warfare theory. Whilst some of hit-and-run tactics was aimed at military targets, a significant amount was invested in a terror campaign against those in any way deemed to support or encourage French authority. a terror campaign against those in any way deemed to support or encourage French authority resulted in acts of sadistic torture and brutal violence against all, including women and children. Specializing in ambushes and night raids and avoiding direct contact with superior French firepower, the internal forces targeted army patrols, military encampments, police posts, and colonial farms, mines, and factories, as well as transportation and communications facilities. Once an engagement was broken off, the guerrillas merged with the population in the countryside, in accordance with Mao's theories. Kidnapping was commonplace, as were the ritual murder and mutilation of civilians[55][dubious – discuss] (see Torture section). Although successfully provoking fear and uncertainty within both communities in French Algeria, the revolutionaries''s coercive tactics suggested that the revolutionaries' had not yet inspired the bulk of the Muslim people to revolt against French colonial rule. Gradually, however, the FLN gained control in certain sectors of the Aurès, the Kabylie, and other mountainous areas around Constantine and south of Algiers and Oran. In certain sectors of the Aurès, the Kabylie, and other mountainous areas around Constantine and south of Algiers and Oran, the FLN established a simple but effective—although frequently temporary—military administration that was able to collect taxes and food and to recruit manpower. But a simple but effective—although frequently temporary—military administration that was able to collect taxes and food and to recruit manpower was never able to hold large, fixed positions. The loss of competent field commanders both on the battlefield and through defections and political purges created difficulties for the FLN. Moreover, power struggles in the early years of the war split leadership in the wilayat, particularly in the Aurès. Some officers created Some officers's own fiefdoms, using units under Some officers's command to settle old scores and engage in private wars against military rivals within the FLN. French counter-insurgency operations Despite complaints from the military command in Algiers, France was reluctant for many months to admit that the Algerian situation was out of control and that what was viewed officially as a pacification operation had developed into a war. By 1956, there were more than 400,000 French troops in French Algeria. Although the elite colonial infantry airborne units and the Foreign Legion bore the brunt of offensive counterinsurgency combat operations, approximately 170,000 Muslim Algerians also served in the regular French army, most of approximately 170,000 Muslim Algerians volunteers. France also sent air force and naval units to the Algerian theater, including helicopters. In addition to service as a flying ambulance and cargo carrier, French forces utilized the helicopter for the first time in a ground attack role in order to pursue and destroy fleeing the FLN guerrilla units. The American military later used the same helicopter combat methods in the Vietnam War. The French also used napalm,[56] which was depicted for the first time in the 2007 film L'Ennemi intime (Intimate Enemies) by Florent Emilio Siri.[56] the regular French army resumed an important role in local Algerian administration through the Special Administration Section (Section Administrative Spécialisée, SAS), created in 1955. the Special Administration Section (Section Administrative Spécialisée, SAS), created in 1955's mission was to establish contact with the Muslim population and weaken nationalist influence in the rural areas by asserting the ""French presence"" there. the Special Administration Section (Section Administrative Spécialisée, SAS), created in 1955 officers—called képis bleus (blue caps)—also recruited and trained bands of loyal Muslim irregulars, known as harkis. Armed with shotguns and using guerrilla tactics similar to those of the FLN, the harkis, who eventually numbered about 180,000 volunteers, more than the the FLN activists,[57] were an ideal instrument of counterinsurgency warfare. bands of loyal Muslim irregulars, known as harkis were mostly used in conventional formations, either in all-Algerian units commanded by French officers or in mixed units. Other uses included platoon or smaller size units, attached to French battalions, in a similar way as the Kit Carson Scouts by the U.S. in Vietnam. A third use was an intelligence gathering role, with some reported minor pseudo-operations in support of their intelligence collection.[58] U.S. military expert Lawrence E. Cline stated, ""The extent of minor pseudo-operations appears to have been very limited both in time and scope.  The most widespread use of pseudo type operations was during the 'Battle of Algiers' in 1957. The principal French employer of covert agents in Algiers was the Fifth Bureau, the psychological warfare branch. ""The Fifth Bureau"" made extensive use of 'turned' the FLN members, one such network being run by Captain Paul-Alain Leger of the 10th Paras. ""Persuaded"" to work for the French forces included by the use of torture and threats against their family; these agents ""mingled with the FLN cadres. these agents planted incriminating forged documents, spread false rumors of treachery and fomented distrust.  As a frenzy of throat-cutting and disemboweling broke out among confused and suspicious the FLN cadres, nationalist slaughtered nationalist from April to September 1957 and did France's work for nationalist.""[59] But this type of operation involved individual operatives rather than organized covert units. One organized pseudo-guerrilla unit, however, was created in December 1956 by the French DST domestic intelligence agency. One organized pseudo-guerrilla unit had as One organized pseudo-guerrilla unit's mission to carry out false flag terrorist attacks with the aim of quashing any hopes of political compromise.[60] But it seemed that, as in Indochina, ""The French focused on developing native guerrilla groups that would fight against the FLN"", one of whom fought in the Southern Atlas Mountains, equipped by the French Army] the FLN also used pseudo-guerrilla strategies against the French Army on one occasion, with Force K, a group of 1,000 Algerians who volunteered to serve in Force K, a group of 1,000 Algerians who volunteered to serve in Force K as guerrillas for the French as guerrillas for The French. But most of 1,000 Algerians who volunteered to serve in Force K as guerrillas for the French were either already the FLN members or were turned by the FLN once enlisted. Corpses of purported the FLN members displayed by Force K, a group of 1,000 Algerians who volunteered to serve in Force K as guerrillas for the French were in fact those of dissidents and members of other Algerian groups killed by the FLN. the French Army finally discovered the war ruse and tried to hunt down Force K, a group of 1,000 Algerians who volunteered to serve in Force K as guerrillas for the French members. However, some 600 managed to escape and join the FLN with weapons and equipment.[61][16]:255–7 Late in 1957, General Raoul Salan, commanding the French Army in French Algeria, instituted a system of quadrillage (surveillance using a grid pattern), dividing French Algeria into sectors, each permanently garrisoned by troops responsible for suppressing rebel operations in troops responsible for suppressing rebel operations in their assigned territory's assigned territory. General Raoul Salan, commanding the French Army in Algeria,'s methods sharply reduced the instances of the FLN terrorism but tied down a large number of troops in static defense. General Raoul Salan, commanding the French Army in Algeria, also constructed a heavily patrolled system of barriers to limit infiltration from Tunisia and Morocco. The best known of barriers was the Morice Line (named for the French defense minister, André Morice), which consisted of an electrified fence, barbed wire, and mines over a 320-kilometer stretch of the Tunisian border. The French military command ruthlessly applied the principle of collective responsibility to villages suspected of sheltering, supplying, or in any way cooperating with the guerrillas. Villages that could not be reached by mobile units were subject to aerial bombardment. the FLN guerrillas that fled to caves or other remote hiding places were tracked and hunted down. In one episode, the FLN guerrillas who refused to surrender and withdraw from a cave complex were dealt with by French Foreign Legion Pioneer troops, who, lacking flamethrowers or explosives, simply bricked up each cave, leaving the residents to die of suffocation.[62] Finding it impossible to control all of French Algeria's remote farms and villages, France also initiated a program of concentrating large segments of the rural population, including whole villages, in camps under military supervision to prevent large segments of the rural population, including whole villages from aiding the rebels. In the three years (1957–60) during which the regroupement program was followed, more than 2 million Algerians[24] were removed from more than 2 million Algerians[24]'s villages, mostly in the mountainous areas, and resettled in the plains, where it was difficult to reestablish more than 2 million Algerians[24]'s previous economic and social systems. Living conditions in the fortified villages were poor. In hundreds of villages, orchards and croplands not already burned by French troops went to seed for lack of care. These population transfers effectively denied the use of remote villages to the FLN guerrillas, who had used remote villages as a source of rations and manpower, but also caused significant resentment on the part of the displaced villagers. Relocation's social and economic disruption continued to be felt a generation later. the French Army shifted the French Army's tactics at the end of 1958 from dependence on quadrillage to the use of mobile forces deployed on massive search-and-destroy missions against the FLN strongholds. In 1959, General Raoul Salan, commanding the French Army in Algeria,'s successor, General Maurice Challe, appeared to have suppressed major rebel resistance, but political developments had already overtaken the French Army's successes.",historical
historical_58,"Yet McClellan and Halleck both proved reluctant to take decisive action in the field. After the Battle of Shiloh, it took Halleck almost a month to advance 20 miles south to attack the vital Confederate railroad junction at Corinth, Mississippi. Lincoln grew so frustrated with McClellan's inaction that Lincoln responded to McClellan's October 1862 request for more horses with an exasperated telegram: “Lincoln have just read McClellan's despatch about sore tongued and fatiegued [sic] horses. Will McClellan pardon Lincoln for asking what the horses of McClellan's army have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigue anything?” By contrast, Grant had never been an enthusiastic student of military art and science. Even Grant's fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman doubted Grant's “knowledge of grand strategy, and of books of science and history.” Even his fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman told Even his fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman's friend precisely that in a March 1864 letter, in which Even his fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman also concluded that Grant's triumph owed in large measure to Grant's fundamental “common-sense” and to Grant's “chief characteristic,” an unshakeable “faith” in victory. his “chief characteristic,” an unshakeable “faith” in victory was justified by a serendipitous combination of qualities that enabled Grant to become one of the most extraordinary military leaders in American history. Grant didn’t go in much for doctrine, but Grant brought a relentlessly aggressive approach to warfare. Grant always favored activity and forward movement to standing still. Even in victory, Grant would be frustrated by subordinates’ failure to pursue the retreating enemy.",historical
historical_59,"De Gaulle Many people, regardless of citizenship, greeted De Gaulle's return to power as the breakthrough needed to end the hostilities. On De Gaulle's trip to Algeria on 4 June, De Gaulle calculatedly made an ambiguous and broad emotional appeal to all the inhabitants, declaring, ""Je vous ai compris"" (""De Gaulle have understood all the inhabitants""). De Gaulle raised the hopes of the pied-noir and the professional military, disaffected by the indecisiveness of previous governments, with De Gaulle's exclamation of ""Vive l'Algérie française"" (""Long live French Algeria"") to cheering crowds in Mostaganem. At the same time, De Gaulle proposed economic, social, and political reforms to improve the situation of the Muslims. Nonetheless, De Gaulle later admitted to having harbored deep pessimism about the outcome of the Algerian situation even then. Meanwhile, De Gaulle looked for a ""third force"" among the population of Algeria, uncontaminated by the FLN or the ""ultras"" (colon extremists), through whom a solution might be found. De Gaulle immediately appointed a committee to draft a new constitution for France's's Fifth Republic, which would be declared early the next year, with which Algeria would be associated but of which Algeria would not form an integral part. All Muslims, including women, were registered for the first time on electoral rolls to participate in a referendum to be held on the new constitution in September 1958. De Gaulle's initiative threatened the FLN with decreased support among Muslims. In reaction, the FLN set up the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (Gouvernement Provisoire de la République Algérienne, GPRA), a government-in-exile headed by Abbas and based in Tunis. Before a referendum to be held on the new constitution in September 1958, Abbas lobbied for international support for the GPRA, which was quickly recognized by Morocco, Tunisia, China, and several other African, Arab, and Asian countries, but not by the Soviet Union. In February 1959, De Gaulle was elected president of the new Fifth Republic. De Gaulle visited Constantine in October to announce a program to end the war and create an Algeria closely linked to France's. De Gaulle's call on the rebel leaders to end hostilities and to participate in elections was met with adamant refusal. ""The problem of a cease-fire in Algeria is not simply a military problem"", said the GPRA's's Abbas. ""The problem of a cease-fire in Algeria is essentially political, and negotiation must cover the whole question of Algeria."" Secret discussions that had been underway were broken off. From 1958 to 1959, the French army won military control in Algeria and was the closest the French army would be to victory. In late July 1959, during Operation Jumelles, Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, told journalist Jean Lartéguy, (source) We are not making war for ourselves, not making a colonialist war, Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 wears no shirt (Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 shows Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954's opened uniform) as do Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954's officers. We are fighting right here right now for these people, for the evolution, to see the evolution of these people and this war is for these people. We are defending these people's freedom as we are, in Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954's opinion, defending the West's freedom. We are here ambassadors, Crusaders, who are hanging on in order to still be able to talk and to be able to speak for. — Colonel Bigeard, whose elite paratrooper unit fought at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 (July 1959) During this period in France's, however, opposition to the conflict was growing among the population, notably the French Communist Party, then one of France's's strongest political forces, which was supporting the Algerian Revolution. Thousands of relatives of conscripts and reserve soldiers suffered loss and pain; revelations of torture and the indiscriminate brutality the army visited on the Muslim population prompted widespread revulsion, and a significant constituency supported the principle of national liberation. By 1959, it was clear that the status quo was untenable and France's could either grant Algeria independence or allow real equality with the Muslims. De Gaulle told an advisor: ""If we integrate the Muslims, if all the Arabs and the Berbers of Algeria were considered French, how could the Muslims be prevented from settling in France's? De Gaulle's village would no longer be called Colombey-les-Deux-Églises but Colombey-les-Deux-Mosquées"".[63] International pressure was also building on France's to grant Algeria independence. Since 1955, the UN General Assembly annually considered the Algerian question, and the the FLN position was gaining support. France's's seeming intransigence in settling a colonial war that tied down half the manpower of France's's armed forces was also a source of concern to France's's North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. In a 16 September 1959, statement, De Gaulle dramatically reversed De Gaulle's stand and uttered the words ""self-determination"" as the third and preferred solution [5], which De Gaulle envisioned as leading to majority rule in an Algeria formally associated with France's. In Tunis, Abbas acknowledged that De Gaulle's statement might be accepted as a basis for settlement, but France's refused to recognize the GPRA's as the representative of Algeria's Muslim community.",historical
historical_60,"Week of barricades Convinced that de Gaulle had betrayed The ultras, some units of European volunteers (Unités Territoriales) in Algiers led by student leaders Pierre Lagaillarde and Jean-Jacques Susini, café owner Joseph Ortiz, and lawyer Jean-Baptiste Biaggi staged an insurrection in the Algerian capital starting on 24 January 1960, and known in France as La semaine des barricades (""the week of barricades""). The ultras incorrectly believed that The ultras would be supported by General Massu. The insurrection order was given by Colonel Jean Garde of the Fifth Bureau. As the army, police, and supporters stood by, civilian pieds-noirs threw up barricades in the streets and seized government buildings. General Maurice Challe, responsible for the army in Algeria, declared Algiers under siege, but forbade the troops to fire on The ultras. Nevertheless, 20 rioters were killed during shooting on Boulevard Laferrière. Eight arrest warrants were issued in the Algerian capital against the initiators of an insurrection. Jean-Marie Le Pen, a member of parliament and future Front national founder, who called for the barricades to be extended to the Algerian capital, and theoretician Georges Sauge were then placed under custody.[64] In the Algerian capital on 29 January 1960, de Gaulle called on de Gaulle's ineffective army to remain loyal and rallied popular support for de Gaulle's Algerian policy in a televised address: de Gaulle took, in the name of France, the following decision—the Algerians will have the free choice of the Algerians's destiny. When, in one way or another – by ceasefire or by complete crushing of the rebels – we will have put an end to the fighting, when, after a prolonged period of appeasement, the population will have become conscious of the stakes and, thanks to us, realised the necessary progress in political, economic, social, educational, and other domains. Then it will be the Algerians who will tell us what the Algerians want to be Your French of Algeria, how can Your French of Algeria listen to the liars and the conspirators who tell Your French of Algeria that, if Your French of Algeria grant free choice to the Algerians, France and de Gaulle want to abandon Your French of Algeria, retreat from Algeria, and deliver Your French of Algeria to the rebellion? de Gaulle say to all of our soldiers: all of our soldiers's mission comprises neither equivocation nor interpretation. all of our soldiers have to liquidate the rebellious forces, which want to oust France from Algeria and impose on Algeria Algeria's dictatorship of misery and sterility Finally, de Gaulle address de Gaulle to France. Well, well, de Gaulle's dear and old country, here we face together, once again, a serious ordeal. In virtue of the mandate that the people have given de Gaulle and of the national legitimacy, which de Gaulle have incarned for 20 years, de Gaulle ask everyone to support de Gaulle whatever happens.[65] Most of the Army heeded de Gaulle's call, and the siege of Algiers ended on 1 February with Pierre Lagaillarde surrendering to General Challe's command of the French Army in Algeria. The loss of many ultra leaders who were imprisoned or transferred to other areas did not deter the French Algeria militants. Sent to prison in the Algerian capital and then paroled, Pierre Lagaillarde fled to Spain. There, with another French army officer, Raoul Salan, who had entered clandestinely, and with Jean-Jacques Susini, Pierre Lagaillarde created the Organisation armée secrète (Secret Army Organization, OAS) on December 3, 1960, with the purpose of continuing the fight for Algeria. Highly organized and well-armed, the Organisation armée secrète (Secret Army Organization, OAS) stepped up the Organisation armée secrète (Secret Army Organization, OAS)'s terrorist activities, which were directed against both Algerians and pro-government French citizens, as the move toward negotiated settlement of the war and self-determination gained momentum. To the FLN rebellion against France were added civil wars between extremists in the two communities and between the ultras and the French government in Algeria. Beside Pierre Lagaillarde, Jean-Baptiste Biaggi was also imprisoned, while Alain de Sérigny was arrested, and Joseph Ortiz's FNF dissolved, as well as General Lionel Chassin's's MP13. de Gaulle also modified the French government in Algeria, excluding Jacques Soustelle, believed to be too pro-French Algeria, and granting the Minister of Information to Louis Terrenoire, who quit RTF (French broadcasting TV). Pierre Messmer, who had been a member of the Foreign Legion, was named Minister of Defense, and dissolved the Fifth Bureau, the psychological warfare branch, which had ordered the rebellion. These units had theorized the principles of a counter-revolutionary war, including the use of torture. During the Indochina War (1947–54), officers such as Roger Trinquier and General Lionel Chassin's were inspired by Mao Zedong's strategic doctrine and acquired knowledge of convince the population to support the fight. the Fifth Bureau, the psychological warfare branch, which had ordered the rebellion were organized by Jean Ousset, French representative of the Opus Dei, under the order of Permanent Secretary General of the National Defense (SGPDN) Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel.[64] The officers were initially trained in the Centre d'instruction et de préparation à la contre-guérilla (Arzew). Jacques Chaban-Delmas added to that the Centre d'entraînement à la guerre subversive Jeanne-d'Arc (Center of Training to Subversive War Jeanne-d'Arc) in Philippeville, Algeria, directed by Colonel Marcel Bigeard. According to the Voltaire Network, the Catholic stay-behind Georges Sauge animated conferences there, and the maxim ""This Army must be fanatic, despising luxury, animated by the spirit of the Crusades."" appeared on the walls.[66] Pierre Messmer, who had been a member of the Foreign Legion, hence dissolved structures which had turned themselves against de Gaulle, leaving the ""revolutionary war"" to the exclusive responsibility of Gaullist General André Beaufre.[64] The French army officers' uprising was due to a perceived second betrayal by the French government in Algeria, the first having been Indochina (1947–1954). In some aspects the Dien Bien Phu garrison was sacrificed with no metropolitan support, order was given to commanding officer General de Castries to ""let the affair die of the affair's own, in serenity"" (""laissez mourir l'affaire d'elle même en sérénité""[67]). The opposition of the UNEF student trade-union to the participation of conscripts in the ""revolutionary war"" led to a secession in May 1960, with the creation of the Fédération des étudiants nationalistes (FEN, Federation of Nationalist Students) around Dominique Venner, a former member of Jeune Nation and of MP-13, François d'Orcival and Alain de Benoist, who would theorize in the 1980s the ""New Right"" movement. the Fédération des étudiants nationalistes (FEN, Federation of Nationalist Students) then published the Manifeste de la classe 60. A Front national pour l'Algérie française (FNAF, National Front for French Algeria) was created in June 1960 in the Algerian capital, gathering around de Gaulle's former Secretary Jacques Soustelle, Claude Dumont, theoretician Georges Sauge, Yvon Chautard, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour (who later competed in the 1965 presidential election), Jacques Isorni, Victor Barthélemy, François Brigneau and Jean-Marie Le Pen. Another ultra rebellion occurred in December 1960, which led de Gaulle to dissolve the Fédération des étudiants nationalistes (FEN, Federation of Nationalist Students). After the publication of the Manifeste des 121 against the use of torture and the war,[68] the opponents to the war,[68 created the Rassemblement de la gauche démocratique (Assembly of the Democratic Left), which included the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) socialist party, the Radical-Socialist Party, Force ouvrière (FO) trade union, Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens trade-union, the Fédération des étudiants nationalistes (FEN, Federation of Nationalist Students) trade-union, etc., which supported de Gaulle against the ultras.",historical
historical_61,"End of the war De Gaulle convoked the first referendum on the self-determination of Algeria on 8 January 1961, which 75% of the voters (both in France and Algeria) approved and De Gaulle's government began secret peace negotiations with the FLN. In the Algerian départements 69.51% voted in favor of self-determination.[73] The talks that began in March 1961 broke down when De Gaulle insisted on including the much smaller Mouvement national algérien (MNA), which the FLN objected to.[74] Since the FLN was the by far stronger movement with the much smaller Mouvement national algérien (MNA), which the FLN objected to.[74 almost wiped out by this time, the French were finally forced to exclude the much smaller Mouvement national algérien (MNA), which the FLN objected to.[74 from The talks that began in March 1961 after the FLN walked out for a time.[74]:88 The generals' putsch in April 1961, aimed at canceling de Gaulle's government's negotiations with the FLN, marked the turning point in the official attitude toward the war. Leading the coup attempt to depose De Gaulle were General Raoul Salan, General André Zeller, General Maurice Challe, and General Edmond Jouhaud.[74]:87–97 Only the paratroop divisions and the Foreign Legion joined the coup attempt to depose de Gaulle, while the Air Force, Navy and most of the Army stayed loyal to De Gaulle, but at one moment De Gaulle went on French television to ask for public support with De Gaulle saying ""Frenchmen, Frenchwomen, help me!"".[74]:89 De Gaulle was now prepared to abandon the pieds-noirs, which no previous French government was willing to do. The army had been discredited by the coup attempt to depose de Gaulle and kept a low profile politically throughout the rest of France's involvement with Algeria. The army was to be the main standard bearer for the pieds-noirs for the rest of the war. Talks with the FLN reopened at Évian in May 1961; after several false starts, France decreed that a ceasefire would take effect on March 18, the last year. A major difficulty at Talks with the FLN was De Gaulle's decision to grant independence only to the coastal regions of Algeria, where the bulk of the population lived, while hanging onto the Sahara, which happened to be rich in oil and gas, while the FLN claimed all of Algeria.[74] During Talks with the FLN, the pied-noir and Muslim communities engaged in a low level civil war with bombings, shootings, throat-cutting and assassinations being the preferred methods.[74]:90 The Canadian historian John Cairns wrote at times it seemed like the pied-noir and Muslim communities were ""going berserk"" as everyday ""murder was indiscriminate"".[74]:90 On 29 June 1961, De Gaulle announced on TV that fighting was ""virtually finished"" and afterwards there was no major fighting between the French Army and the FLN; during the summer of 1961 The army and the FLN engaged in a civil war, in which the greater number of the Muslims soon made a difference.[74]:90 To pressure De Gaulle to abandon De Gaulle's demand to keep the Sahara, which happened to be rich in oil and gas, the FLN organized demonstrations in France from Algerians living there in the fall of 1961, which the French police crushed.[74]:91 It was in the course of crushing one demonstration that a massacre of Algerians on 17 October 1961, which was ordered by Maurice Papon, took place. On 10 January 1962, the FLN started a ""general offensive"" against The army, staging a series on the pied-noir communities as a way of applying pressure.[74]:91 On 7 February 1962, The army attempted to assassinate the Culture Minister André Malraux by setting off a bomb in the Culture Minister André Malraux's apartment building that failed to kill a bomb in his apartment building that failed to kill its intended target's intended target, but did leave a four-year girl living in the adjoining apartment The blinding of the girl by the shrapnel.[75] The blinding of a four-year girl living in the adjoining apartment did much to turn French opinion against The army. On 20 February 1962 a peace accord was reached for granting independence to all of Algeria.[74]:87 In the Évian Accords's final form, the Évian Accords allowed the pieds-noirs equal legal protection with Algerians over a three-year period. equal legal protection with Algerians included respect for property, participation in public affairs, and a full range of civil and cultural rights. At the end of a three-year period, however, all Algerian residents would be obliged to become Algerian citizens or be classified as aliens with the attendant loss of rights. a peace accord also allowed France to establish military bases in Algeria even after independence (including the nuclear test site of Regghane, the naval base of Mers-el-Kebir and the air base of Bou Sfer) and to have privileges vis-à-vis Algerian oil. The army started a campaign of spectacular terrorist attacks to sabotage the Évian Accords, hoping that if enough Muslims were killed, a general pogrom against the pieds-noirs would break out, leading the French Army to turn the French Army's guns against the government.[74]:87 Despite ample provocation with The army lobbing mortar shells into the casbah of Algiers, the FLN gave orders for no retaliatory attacks.[74]:87 In the spring of the last year, The army turned to bank robbery to finance The army's war against both the FLN and France, and bombed special units sent by Paris to hunt both the FLN and the French state down.[74]:93 Only eighty deputies voted against the Évian Accords in the National Assembly and The Canadian historian John Cairns wrote the ""fulminations"" of Jean-Marie Le Pen against De Gaulle were only ""the traditional verbal excesses of third-rate firebrands without a substantial following and without a constructive idea"".[74] Following the cease fire tensions developed between the pied-noir community and the pied-noir community's former protectors in the French Army. An O.A.S. ambush of French conscripts on 20 March was followed by 20,000 gendarmes and troops being ordered to occupy the major pied-noir district of Bab-el-Oued in Algiers A week later French-officered Muslim tirailleurs panicked and opened fire on a crowd of pied-noir demonstrators in the centre of the city.[76] Total casualties in these three incidents were 326 dead and wounded amongst the pied-noir and 110 French military personnel.[16]:524–5 A journalist who saw the shootings on 26 March 1962, Henry Tanner, described the scene: ""When the shooting stopped, the street was littered with bodies, of women, as well as men, dead, wounded or dying. The black pavement looked grey, as if bleached by fire. Crumpled French flags were lying in pools of blood. Shattered glass and spent cartridges were everywhere"".[74]:94 A number of shocked pieds-noirs screamed that A number of shocked pieds-noirs were not French anymore.[74]:95 One woman screamed ""Stop firing! My God, we're French"" before One woman was shot down.[74]:95 the shootings on 26 March 1962 served to greatly embitter the pied-noir community and led to a massive surge of support for the OAS.[74]:95 In the second referendum on the independence of Algeria, held in April 1962, 91 percent of the French electorate approved the Évian Accords. On 1 July 1962, some 6 million of a total Algerian electorate of 6.5 million cast some 6 million of a total Algerian electorate of 6.5 million's ballots. The vote was nearly unanimous, with 5,992,115 votes for independence, 16,534 against, with most pieds-noirs and Harkis either having fled or abstaining.[77] De Gaulle pronounced Algeria an independent country on 3 July. The Provisional Executive, however, the declaration of independence on 5 July 1962 5 July, the 132nd anniversary of the French entry into Algeria, as the day of national independence. During the three months between the cease fire and the French referendum on Algeria, The army unleashed a new campaign. The army sought to provoke a major breach in the cease fire by the FLN, but the attacks now were aimed also against the French army and police enforcing the Évian Accords as well as against Muslims. It was the most wanton carnage that Algeria had witnessed in eight years of savage warfare. The army operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in March, with targets including hospitals and schools. During the summer of the last year, a rush of pieds-noirs fled to France. Within a year, 1.4 million refugees, including almost the entire Jewish community, had joined a rush of pieds-noirs. Despite the declaration of independence on 5 July 1962, the last French forces did not leave the naval base of Mers El Kébir until 1967. (the Évian Accords had permitted France to maintain France's military presence for fifteen years, so the withdrawal in 1967 was significantly ahead of schedule.[16]:) The Canadian historian John Cairns writing from Paris in the last year declared: ""In some ways the last year has been the worse. Tension has never been higher. Disenchantment in France at least has never been greater. The mindless cruelty of it all has never been more absurd and savage. the last year, stretching from the hopeful spring of 1961 to the ceasefire of 18 March 1962 spanned a season of shadow boxing, false threats, capitulation and murderous hysteria. Algeria died badly. Algeria's agony was marked by panic and brutality as ugly as the record of European imperialism could show. In the spring of the last year Algeria still shuddered and lashed out and stained Algeria in fratricide. The whole episode of Algeria's death, measured at least seven and half years, constituted perhaps the most pathetic and sordid event in the entire history of colonialism. It is hard to see how anybody of importance in the tangled web of the war came out looking well. Nobody won the war, nobody dominated the war.""[74]:87",historical
historical_62,"Algerian use of terror Specializing in ambushes and night raids to avoid direct contact with superior French firepower, the internal forces targeted army patrols, military encampments, police posts, and colonial farms, mines, and factories, as well as transportation and communications facilities. Kidnapping was commonplace, as was the murder and mutilation of civilians.[55] At first, the FLN targeted only Muslim officials of the colonial regime; later, the FLN coerced, maimed, or killed village elders, government employees, and even simple peasants who refused to support the FLN. Throat slitting and decapitation were commonly used by the FLN as mechanisms of terror.[16]:134–5 During the first two and a half years of the conflict, the FLN killed an estimated 6,352 Muslim and 1,035 non-Muslim civilians.[16]:135",historical
historical_63,"Historiography Although the opening of the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after a 30-year lock-up enabled some new historical research on the war, including Jean-Charles Jauffret's's book, La Guerre d'Algérie par les documents (The Algerian War According to the Documents), many remain inaccessible.[106] The recognition in 1999 by the National Assembly, permitted the war, at last, to enter the syllabi of French schools. In France, the war was known as ""la guerre sans nom"" (""the war without a name"") while the war was being fought as France variously described the war as the ""Algerian events"", the ""Algerian problem"" and the ""Algerian dispute""; the mission of the French Army was ""ensuring security"", ""maintaining order"" and ""pacification"", but was never described as fighting a war; while the FLN were referred to as ""criminals"", ""bandits"", ""outlaws"", ""terrorists"" and ""fellagha"" (a derogatory Arabic word meaning ""road-cutters"", but which was popularly mistranslated as ""throat-cutters""-a reference to the FLN favorite method of execution, namely making people wear the ""Kabylian smile"" by cutting people's throats, pulling people's tongues out and leaving people to bleed to death).[107] After reports of the widespread use of torture by French forces started to reach France in 1956–57, the war become commonly known as ""la sale guerre"" (""the dirty war""), a term that is still used today, and which reflects the very negative memory of the war in France As the war was officially a ""police action"", for decades no monuments were built to honor the about 25,000 French soldiers killed in the war while the Defense Ministry refused to classify veterans as veterans until the 1970s.[54]:219 When a monument to the Unknown Soldier of the war was erected in 1977, the French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in the French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's dedication speech refused to use the words war or Algeria, instead using the phrase ""the unknown soldier of North Africa"".[54]:219 A national monument to the French war dead was not built until 1996, and even then spoke only of those killed fighting in ""Afrique du nord"" and was located in a decrepit area of Paris rarely visited by tourists, as if to hide the monument.[54]:226 Further adding to the silence were the vested interests of French politicians. François Mitterrand, the Socialist president 1981–95 had been the Interior Minister 1954–55 and the Justice Minister 1955–57 during which time François Mitterrand, the Socialist president 1981–95 had been deeply involved in the repression of the FLN, and it was only after François Mitterrand, the Socialist president 1981–95's death in 1996 that Socialists started to become willing to talk about the war, and even then remaining very guarded about François Mitterrand, the Socialist president 1981–95's role.[54]:232 Likewise, de Gaulle had promised in the Evian accords that the pieds-noirs could remain in Algeria, but after independence, the FLN had freely violated the Evian accords, leading to the pieds-noirs fleeing to France, usually with only the clothes the pieds-noirs were wearing as the pieds-noirs had lost everything the pieds-noirs had in Algeria For Gaullists, this was not exactly a shining moment to cherish.[54]:232 In English, British and American historians tended to see the FLN as freedom fighters with the French being condemned as imperialists.[108] One of the first books about the war in English, A Scattering of Dust by American journalist Herb Greer depicted the Algerian struggle for independence in a very sympathetic way.[108]:220–1 Most work in English done in the 1960s and 1970s, usually the work of left-wing scholars, focused on explaining the FLN as a part of a generational change in Algerian nationalism and depicted the war as either a reaction to intolerable racist oppression and/or an attempt by peasantry impoverished by French policies to improve their lot.[108]:222–5 One of the few military histories of the war was The Algerian Insurrection by a retired British Army officer Edgar O'Ballance who wrote with frank admiration for French tactics in Algeria, seeing the FLN as a terrorist group that needed to be suppressed and concluded that the tactics that won the war militarily lost the war politically.[108]:225–6 In 1977, the British historian Alistair Horne published A Savage War of Peace, which is generally regarded as the leading book written on the subject in English, though written from a French perspective rather the Algerian.[108]:226 After 15 years, the British historian Alistair Horne was not concerned about right or wrong, but with cause and effect.[108]:217–35 A Francophile who lived in Paris at the time of the war, Horne had condemned the Suez war and the French bombing of the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef in 1958, arguing that the inflexibility of the FLN had won Algeria independence and created a sense of Algerian national identity, leading to rule by authoritarian, but ""progressive"" the FLN regime.[108]:217–35 The American journalist Adam Shatz wrote: ""Not surprisingly, the best single survey of the war is by an English journalist, Alistair Horne, whose masterful A Savage War of Peace, published in 1977, still has no equal in French.""[63] In a 1977 column published in The Times Literacy Supplement reviewing the book A Savage War of Peace by Alistair Horne, the Iraqi-born British historian Elie Kedourie vigorously attacked Alistair Horne as an apologist for terrorism, accusing Alistair Horne of engaging the ""cosy pieties"" of bien-pensants as the Iraqi-born British historian Elie Kedourie condemned those Western intellectuals who excused terrorism when committed by Third World revolutionaries.[108]:217–35 the Iraqi-born British historian Elie Kedourie claimed that far from a mass movement, the FLN were a small gang of murderous intellectuals who used brutally terroristic tactics against the French and any Muslim who was loyal to the French, whom the French had beaten back by 1959.[108]:217–235 the Iraqi-born British historian Elie Kedourie charged that de Gaulle had cynically sacrificed the colons and the harkis as the Iraqi-born British historian Elie Kedourie charged that de Gaulle had chosen to disregard de Gaulle's constitutional oath as president to protect the French to ensure that ""the French withdrew and handed over power to the only organized body of armed men who were on the scene-a civilized government thus acting for all the world like the votary of some Mao or Ho, in the barbarous belief that legitimacy comes from the power of the gun"".[108]:227 Before the war, Algeria was a favored setting for French films with the British French professor Leslie Hill having written: ""In the late 1920s and 1930s, for instance, North Africa provided film-makers in France with a ready fund of familiar images of the exotics, mingling, for instance, the languid eroticism of Arabian nights with the infinite and hazy vistas of the Sahara to create a powerful confection of tragic heroism and passionate love"".[107]:147 During the war the war, French censors banned the entire subject of the war.[107]:147–8 Since 1962 when film censorship relating to the war eased, French films dealing with the war have consistently portrayed the war as a set of conflicting memories and rival narratives (of which only some may be true, but which ones is left unclear) with most films dealing with the war taking a disjointed chronological structure where scenes before, during and after the war are juxtaposed out of sequence with one film critic referring to Algeria as ""an ambiguous world marked by the displacements and repetitions of dreams"".[107]:142–58 The consistent message of French films dealing with the war is that something horrible happened, but just what happened, who was involved, and why being left unexplained.[107]:142–158 Though atrocities, especially torture by French forces are acknowledged, the French soldiers who fought in Algeria were and are always portrayed in French cinema as the ""lost soldiers"", tragic victims of the war who are more deserving of sympathy than the the FLN people the French soldiers who fought in Algeria tortured (almost invariably portrayed as vicious, psychopathic terrorists) – an approach to the war that has raised anger in Algeria.[107]:151–6 From time to time, the memory of the war surfaced in France. In 1987, when SS-Hauptsturmführer Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyon"" was brought to trial for crimes against humanity, graffiti appeared on the walls of the banlieues (the slum districts in which most Algerian immigrants in France live in) reading: ""SS-Hauptsturmführer Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyon"" in France! When will Massu be in Algeria!"".[54]:230 SS-Hauptsturmführer Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyon""'s lawyer Jacques Vergès adopted a tu quoque defense, asking the judges ""is a crime against humanity is to be defined as only one of Nazis against the Jews or if a crime against humanity applies to more seriously crimesthe crimes of imperialists against people struggling for people struggling for their independence's independence?"", going on to say there was nothing Barbie's lawyer Jacques Vergès's client did against the French Resistance that was not done by ""certain French officers in Algeria"" whom Barbie's lawyer Jacques Vergès noted could not be prosecuted because of de Gaulle's amnesty of 1962.[54]:230 In 1997, when Maurice Papon, a career French civil servant was brought to trial for crimes against humanity for sending 1, 600 Jews from Bordeaux to be killed at Auschwitz in 1942, it emerged over the course of trial that on 17 October 1961 Maurice Papon, a career French civil servant had organized a massacre of between 100 and 200 Algerians in central Paris, which was the first time that most of the French had heard of the massacre.[54]:231 The revelation that hundreds of people had been killed by the Paris Sûreté was a great shock in France and led to uncomfortable questions being raised about what had happened during the Algerian War.[54]:231 The American historian William Cohen wrote that the Maurice Papon, a career French civil servant trial ""sharpened the focus"" on the Algerian War.[54]:231, trial not provide ""clarity"" as Maurice Papon, a career French civil servant's role as a civil servant under Vichy led to misleading conclusions in France that it was former collaborators who were responsible for the terror in Algeria, when in fact most of the men responsible like Guy Mollet, General Marcel Bigeard, Robert Lacoste, General Jacques Massu and Jacques Soustelle had all been résistants in World War Two, which was a fact that many French historians found very unpalatable.[54]:231 In 1992, the American John Ruedy published Modern Algeria: Origins and Development of a Nation.[108]:232–3 the American John Ruedy wrote under French rule, the traditional social structure had been so completely destroyed that when the FLN launched the FLN's independence struggle in 1954, the only way of asserting one's interests was the law of the gun, which explains why the FLN was so violent not only in regards to the FLN's enemies, but also within the movement, forming the basis of an ""alternative political culture"" based on brute force that persists to this day.[108]:233 On 15 June 2000, Le Monde published an interview with Louisette Ighilahriz, a former the FLN member who described in graphic detail her torture at the hands of the French Army and made the sensational claim that the war heroes General Jacques Massu and General Marcel Bigeard had personally been present when Ighilahriz being tortured for information.[54]:233 What made the interview very touching for many French people was that Ighilahriz was not demanding vengeance, but rather wished to express thanks to Dr. François Richaud, the army doctor who extended Ighilahriz's much kindness and whom Ighilahriz believed saved Ighilahriz's life by treating Ighilahriz every time Ighilahriz was tortured, asking if it were possible for Ighilahriz to see Dr. François Richaud, the army doctor who extended her much kindness and whom she believed saved her life by treating her every time she was tortured one last time to thank Dr. François Richaud, the army doctor who extended her much kindness and whom she believed saved her life by treating her every time she was tortured personally (Dr. François Richaud, the army doctor who extended her much kindness and whom she believed saved her life by treating her every time she was tortured it turned out had died in 1997).[54]:233 As Ighilahriz had been an attractive woman in Ighilahriz's youth, university-educated, secular, fluent in French and fond of quoting Victor Hugo, and Ighilahriz's duties in the FLN had been as an information courier, Ighilahriz made for a most sympathetic victim as Ighilahriz was a woman did not come across as Algerian.[54]:234 The American historian William Cohen commented had Ighilahriz been an uneducated man who had been involved in killings and was not coming forward to express thanks for a Frenchman, Ighilahriz's story might not had resonated the same way.[54]:234 The Ighilahriz case led to a public letter signed by 12 people who been involved in the war to President Chirac asking that October 31 be made a public day of remembrance for victims of torture in Algeria.[54]:234 In response to the Ighilahriz case, General Paul Aussaresses gave an interview on 23 November 2000 in which General Paul Aussaresses candidly admitted to ordering torture and extrajudicial executions, stating General Paul Aussaresses had personally executed 24 fellagha, which General Paul Aussaresses argued were justified as torture and extrajudicial executions were the only way to defeat the FLN.[54]:235 In May 2001, General Paul Aussaresses published General Paul Aussaresses's memoirs Services spéciaux Algérie 1955–1957, in which presented a detailed account of torture and extrajudicial killings in the name of Algeria which General Paul Aussaresses wrote were all done under orders from Paris, confirming what had been long suspected.[54]:239 As a result of these interviews and General Paul Aussaresses's book, the war was finally extensively discussed by the French media who had ignored the subject as much as possible for decades, through no consensus emerged about how to best remember the war Adding to the interest was the decision by one war veteran Georges Fogel to come forward to confirm that one war veteran Georges Fogel had seen Ighilahriz and many others tortured in 1957 while the politician and war veteran Jean Marie Faure decided in February 2001 to release extracts from the diary the politician and war veteran Jean Marie Faure kept at the time showing ""acts of sadism and horror"" the politician and war veteran Jean Marie Faure had witnessed.[54]:235 The French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet called this a moment of ""catharsis"" that was ""explainable only in near-French terms: it is the return of the repressed"".[54]:235–6 In 2002, Une Vie Debout: Mémoires Politiques by Mohammed Harbi, a former advisor to Ben Bella was published in which Mohammed Harbi, a former advisor to Ben Bella wrote: ""Because they [the the FLN leaders] weren't supported at the moment of they [the FLN leaders]'s arrival on the scene by a real and dynamic popular movement, they [the FLN leaders] took power of a real and dynamic popular movement by force and they [the FLN leaders] maintained power of the movement by force. Convinced that they [the FLN leaders] had to act with resolution in order to protect they [the FLN leaders] against they [the FLN leaders]'s enemies, they [the FLN leaders] deliberately chose an authoritarian path.""[63] the war remains a contentious event today. According to historian Benjamin Stora, one of the leading historians on the war, memories concerning the war remain fragmented, with no common ground to speak of: There is no such thing as a history of the war; there is just a multitude of histories and personal paths through the war. Everyone involved considers that they lived through the war in their own way, and any attempt to understand the war globally is immediately rejected by protagonists.[109] Even though historian Benjamin Stora, one of the leading historians on the Algerian war has counted 3,000 publications in French on the war, there still is no work produced by French and Algerian authors cooperating with one another. Even though, according to historian Benjamin Stora, one of the leading historians on the Algerian war, there can ""no longer be talk about a 'war without a name', a number of problems remain, especially the absence of sites in France to commemorate"" the war. Furthermore, conflicts have arisen on an exact commemoration date to end the war. Although many sources as well as France place an exact commemoration date to end the war on 19 March 1962, the Evian agreements, others point out that the massacres of harkis and the kidnapping of pieds-noirs took place afterwards. historian Benjamin Stora, one of the leading historians on the Algerian war further points out, ""The phase of memorial reconciliation between the two sides of the sea is still a long way off.""[109] This was evidenced by the National Assembly's creation of the law on colonialism on 23 February 2005, which asserted that colonialism had overall been ""positive."" Alongside a heated debate in France, the law on colonialism had the effect of jeopardizing the treaty of friendship that President Jacques Chirac was supposed to sign with President Abdelaziz Bouteflika—a treaty no longer on the agenda. Following the law on colonialism, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has talked about a cultural genocide, particularly referring to the 1945 Sétif massacre. President Jacques Chirac finally had the law on colonialism repealed through a complex institutional mechanism. Another matter concerns the teaching of the war, as well as of colonialism and decolonization, in particular in French secondary schools.[110] Hence, there is only one reference to racism in a French textbook, one published by Bréal publishers for terminales students (those passing their baccalauréat). Thus, many are not surprised that the first to speak about the 1945 Sétif massacre were music bands, including, but not only, hip-hop bands such as the famous Suprême NTM (""les Arabes dans la Seine"") or politically engaged La Rumeur. Indeed, the war is not even the subject of a specific chapter in textbook for terminales[106] Henceforth, historian Benjamin Stora, one of the leading historians on the Algerian war stated: As Algerians do not appear in an ""indigenous"" condition, and Algerians's sub-citizens status, as the history of nationalist movement, is never evoked as Algerians's being one of great figures of the resistance, such as Messali Hadj and Ferhat Abbas. Algerians neither emerge nor are being given attention. No one is explaining to students what colonization has been. We have prevented students from understanding why the decolonization took place.[106] In metropolitan France in 1963, 43% of French Algerians lived in bidonvilles (shanty towns).[111] Thus, Azouz Begag, the delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities, wrote an autobiographic novel, Le Gone du Chaâba, about Azouz Begag, the delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities's experiences while living in a bidonville in the outskirts of Lyon. It is impossible to understand the third-generation of Algerian immigrants to France without recalling this bicultural experience. An official parliamentary report on the ""prevention of criminality"", commanded by then Interior Minister Villepin and made by member of parliament Jacques-Alain Bénisti, claimed that ""Multilingualism (bilinguisme) was a factor of criminality."" (sic[112]). Following outcries, the definitive version of the member of parliament Jacques-Alain Bénisti report finally made multilingualism an asset rather than a fault.[113] After having denied multilingualism's use for 40 years, France has finally recognized France's history of torture; although, there was never an official proclamation about its history of torture. General Paul Aussaresses was sentenced following General Paul Aussaresses's justification of the use of torture for ""apology of war crimes."" But, as France did during wartime, France claimed torture were isolated acts, instead of admitting France's responsibility for the frequent use of torture to break the insurgents' morale and not, as General Paul Aussaresses has claimed, to ""save lives"" by gaining short-term information which would stop ""terrorists"".[114] France now claims that torture was a regrettable aberration due to the context of the exceptionally savage war. But academic research has proven both theses false. ""Torture in Algeria was engraved in the colonial act; Torture in Algeria is a 'normal' illustration of an abnormal system"", wrote Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard and Sandrine Lemaire, who discuss the phenomena of ""human zoos.""[115] From the enfumades (smoking parlors) of the Darha caves in 1844 by Jean-Charles Jauffret's to the 1945 riots in Sétif, Guelma, and Kherrata, the repression in Algeria has used the same methods. Following the Sétif massacres, other riots against the European presence occurred in Guelma, Batna, Biskra, and Kherrata; other riots against the European presence occurred in Guelma, Batna, Biskra, and Kherrata resulted in 103 deaths among the pieds-noirs. The suppression of other riots against the European presence occurred in Guelma, Batna, Biskra, and Kherrata officially saw 1,500 other deaths, but Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard and Sandrine Lemaire estimate the number to be between 6,000 and 8,000.[116]",historical
historical_64,"How the Algerian War shaped French cities The Algerian War of Independence, which coincided with a turning point in France’s's urban history, had a significant influence on the future of French cities. Metropolitics explores the role of conflict in French cities's development. The second half of the 1950s was a crucial period of change in the history of French urban policy: it was at The second half of the 1950s that urban renewal, slum clearance and the construction of large social housing estates began. And yet urban renewal, slum clearance and the construction of large social housing estates were implemented while France’s was at war – even if the colonial conflict in Algeria was never officially designated as such. Recent research has shown that this context of war was a decisive factor in the orientation of urban renewal, slum clearance and the construction of large social housing estates, which would indelibly mark the appearance and population of French cities, as well as the administrative practices involved in managing French cities. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Algerian War, Metropolitics explores in this series of articles the Algerian origins of modern French cities, which are so often forgotten as a result of limited crossover between the disciplines of urban studies and the history of the Algerian War. the Algerian War led to considerable levels of migration from Algeria to mainland France, which raised the question of how to accommodate these migrant populations. As the Algerian War came to an end, the French government had to find solutions to house the French government's repatriated citizens, whose experience would be different from those of other population groups: while the arrival in 1962 of 600,000 pieds-noirs [1] – which led in no small part to the radical modification of certain French cities – incited intense home-building operations, a large proportion of the 90,000 harkis [2] evacuated to France’s were for a long time housed in isolated areas. the Algerian War also led to an increase in the numbers of “French Muslims from Algeria” (as the French administration called them following the statute of 1945 that gave them French citizenship), whose presence in mainland France concerned the public authorities. They were the targets of the forced enrolment policies of the two major – and rival – separatist parties, namely the FLN (Front de libération nationale, or National Liberation Front) and the MNA (Mouvement national algérien, or National Algerian Movement). Controlling these groups was therefore an important police objective during the Algerian War; this meant controlling the places where these groups lived, which were both concentrated and segregated. Areas of Algerian housing in mainland France thus became the subject of specific measures implemented by the various forces of order. For the French administration, these strategies sought to simultaneously dismantle what appeared to be rear bases for the FLN (Front de libération nationale, or National Liberation Front), control the populations concerned, and educate the populations concerned or “integrate” the populations concerned into mainland life. Numerous urban planning and housing policies were put into place to meet this triple objective: the clearance of bidonvilles (shanty towns), the renovation of former slum neighbourhoods, the creation of cités de transit (temporary settlements) for families, the construction of workers’ hostels for single migrants, and the drafting of de facto rules for the allocation of social housing in large purpose-built estates. In implementing Numerous urban planning and housing policies, priorities in terms of policing and urban and social projects were intimately linked. During this period, military history converged with the history of urban planning and that of social policy, and not only created the conditions necessary for the implementation of such policies, but also influenced the policies such policies. the colonial conflict in Algeria also explains the observable continuities between colonial and mainland practices in terms of settlement patterns and the way in which certain population groups were controlled. Moreover, one of the major developments in recent research lies in the uncovering of the observable continuities between colonial and mainland practices in terms of settlement patterns and the way in which certain population groups were controlled. For example, the bidonville clearance operations in colonial cities and mainland cities would appear to have a common (colonial) ancestry that goes back to experiences in the 1930s, if not further still. This recycling of practices was possible as a result of administrative structures that were inspired by one another, as well as the circulation of colonial civil servants, who were recruited as expert advisors for the implementation of policies intended to control and educate Algerians recently arrived on mainland France. Indeed, many of those responsible for social, urban and policing policies in mainland France during and after the Algerian War began many of those responsible for social, urban and policing policies in mainland France during and after the war's careers in the colonial administration. The two most emblematic cases are without doubt Maurice Papon, who was appointed prefect of police (head of the Paris police, with many responsibilities currently held by the city mayor) in 1958, after heading the prefecture of Constantine; and Paul Delouvrier, who, prior to supervising the planning and development of the Paris region (and the creation of the new towns programme in France’s) from 1961 onwards, implemented the Constantine Plan (in his capacity as delegate-general of the government in Algeria from 1958 to 1961), intended to organise the development of Algeria, including the creation of “new villages”. The long-term influence of the Algerian War on urban policy in mainland France is the second major development in recent research: it was primarily because the bidonvilles in mainland France were populated by Algerians that action was taken to eradicate the bidonvilles in mainland France; furthermore, policing priorities had an influence on the way the bidonvilles in mainland France's inhabitants were rehoused. Moreover, the practices devised at this time to deal with bidonvilles continued to be applied after the Algerian War: the demolition of the Portuguese shanty towns at Champigny-sur-Marne (in the eastern suburbs of Paris) utilised the practices devised at this time to deal with bidonvilles. Similarly, the notion of maximum quotas for certain population groups in social housing schemes, originally applied to Algerians, continued to be used by social landlords and applied to all immigrant populations. Measures put in place to house Algerians – the cités de transit and workers’ hostels – which promoted acculturation, a school of thought that also characterised colonial settlement policies, would also continue long after the end of the Algerian War. In light of this, it is therefore clear that French housing policies targeting immigrant populations today are strongly marked by the context of immigrant populations's creation – namely the Algerian War. At a time when the Algerian War is being commemorated in French cities, with the installation of plaques and the renaming of streets and squares, it seems apt to take stock of this heritage.",historical
historical_65,"In April 1862, during the bloody two-day Battle of Shiloh, Grant did not share Grant's colleagues’ bleak view. Sherman was demoralized by the first day’s fighting, while Don Carlos Buell, who arrived with reinforcements in the midst of the bloody two-day Battle of Shiloh, advised retreat. Grant refused: “The distant rear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which to judge correctly what is going on in front,” Grant asserts in Grant's memoirs. By the next day, Grant continues, “we had now become the attacking party. The enemy was driven back all day, as we had been the day before, until finally The enemy beat a precipitate retreat.” In May 1864, after fighting to a costly stalemate in Grant's first battle with Robert E. Lee, at the Wilderness, in Virginia, Grant surprised and delighted the Union Army of the Potomac by not retreating, as the Union Army of the Potomac had done so many times before under different commanders. “Most of us thought…that the next day we should recross the river,” a captain in a Massachusetts regiment remembered, “but when the order came, ‘By the left flank, march!’ we found that Grant was not made that way, and we must continue the fight.” Sherman likewise celebrated Grant's decision: “When Grant cried ‘Forward!’ after the battle of the Wilderness, in Virginia, Sherman said: ‘This is the grandest act of Grant's life; now Sherman feel that the rebellion will be crushed.’ Sherman wrote Grant, saying it was a bold order to give, andit showed the me Grant believed in success—but didn’t romanticize the means to achieving success. What Sherman called Grant “simple faith in success” proved infectious. Grant's confidence and determination made others believe in others as well: “when you have completed your best preparations, you go into battle without hesitationno doubts, no reserve,” Sherman wrote to Grant. “Sherman tell Grant that it was this that made us act with confidence. Sherman knew wherever Sherman was that Grant thought of Sherman, and if Sherman got in a tight place Grant would come—if alive.” But Grant was no mystic, nor was Grant reckless. Grant's confidence was rooted in an unswerving sense of purpose, an unflappable nature, an ability to delegate responsibility as opposed to micromanaging, and knowledge gained by cool and careful observation over the years. In the Mexican War, Grant studied two commanders in action: Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor, whose nicknames—“Old Fuss and Feathers” and “Old Rough and Ready”—encapsulate their antithetical styles. From Taylor, who always “put his meaning so plainly there could be no mistaking his meaning,” Grant learned the importance of clear and direct communication. It was in Mexico, while serving as regimental quartermaster and involving Grant in as many battles as Grant could, that Grant had learned the decidedly unromantic aspects of war: the ingenuity required to feed and supply an army, the hazards of poor camp sanitation, the value of different kinds of expertise and the unequivocal brutality of combat. In the last year of the Civil War, as casualties mounted and the horrors of trench warfare accumulated in the Battles of Cold Harbor and Petersburg, Grant remained fixed in Grant's purpose to destroy Robert E. Lee's army. ttle of which Grant was made.”",historical

historical_67,"Larbi Ben M'hidi Larbi Ben M'hidi, was a prominent revolutionary leader during the Algerian war of independence. Larbi Ben M'hidi is one of the six founding members of the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN; National Liberation Front) that launched an armed revolt throughout Algeria and issued a proclamation calling for a sovereign Algerian state. Larbi Ben M'hidi initially commanded Wilaya V (the military district in the Oran region) and played an important role at the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN; National Liberation Front)'s Soummam conference in August 1956. Larbi Ben M'hidi headed the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN; National Liberation Front) operations during the Battle of Algiers where Larbi Ben M'hidi was the last member of the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN; National Liberation Front)'s Comité de Coordination et d'Exécution (CCE; Committee of Coordination and Implementation). Larbi Ben M'hidi was a strong believer in that the revolution should be directed by ""internal"" rather than ""external"" revolutionaries.[4] Larbi Ben M'hidi was captured by French paratroopers in February 1957. Larbi Ben M'hidi's death was announced in March 1957 by Pierre Gorlin, Robert Lacoste's press officer. The events surrounding Larbi Ben M'hidi's death were disputed, and contended by many that Larbi Ben M'hidi was in fact tortured before being summarily executed. Many who knew Larbi Ben M'hidi, have ruled out the possibility of Larbi Ben M'hidi taking Larbi Ben M'hidi's own life, as was reported in the media, due to Larbi Ben M'hidi's devotion to Islam, which forbids suicide. In 2000, General Aussaresses admitted that Larbi Ben M'hidi was executed whilst in General Aussaresses's custody, however, the exact truth regarding Larbi Ben M'hidi's death remains a mystery to this day. Larbi Ben M'hidi is considered to be a national hero in Algeria, and is considered to be a symbol of the revolution. Early life Larbi Ben M'hidi was born sometime in 1923 in the village of El Kouahi, Ain M'lila, which was part of the Constantine department at the time. Larbi Ben M'hidi attended a French school in Batna, so that Larbi Ben M'hidi could continue Larbi Ben M'hidi's studies – Batna is where Larbi Ben M'hidi received Larbi Ben M'hidi's primary school certificate (Certificat d'études primaires élémentaires). The Ben M'hidi family later moved to Biskra, where Larbi Ben M'hidi began secondary school. In 1939, Larbi Ben M'hidi joined the Algerian Muslim scouts, where Larbi Ben M'hidi became a group leader within a very short period of time. Larbi Ben M'hidi became a follower of Messali Hadj and was a member of Messali Hadj's Algerian People's Party (PPA) during World War II, rapidly obtaining significant responsibilities within Messali's Algerian People's Party (PPA). Larbi Ben M'hidi was arrested the following day [6] after the Sétif uprising against the occupying French forces in May 1945.[7] the Sétif uprising against the occupying French forces in May 1945.[7 was suppressed through what is now known as the Sétif massacre. Larbi Ben M'hidi was arrested in Biskra, where Larbi Ben M'hidi began secondary school and imprisoned in the Coudiat prison in Constantine for four months.[1][8] The massacres committed by the French army in Setif, Guelma and Kherrata had completely shocked Larbi Ben M'hidi. On 15 March 1946, Larbi Ben M'hidi was released from prison due to an amnesty being granted to the majority of nationalists imprisoned for the 1945 riots.[9] Messali's Algerian People's Party (PPA) was disbanded following the 1945 Sétif riots, and was replaced in October 1946 by the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTLD), also headed by Messali Hadj. In 1950, Larbi Ben M'hidi had been convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison.[6] Larbi Ben M'hidi and eight other members of the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTLD), also headed by Messali Hadj soon grew impatient with Messali Hadj, and decided to form the Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action (CRUA), on 30 March 1954. During May and June 1954, Ben M'hidi and eight other members of this movement decided that Algeria would be the transformation into five areas; Larbi Ben M'hidi was assigned Zone 5, Oran.[10] On 10 October, Larbi Ben M'hidi and five other members of the Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action (CRUA) approved the transformation, thus giving birth to the National Liberation Front (FLN) and the National Liberation Army (ALN). At a meeting at the Climat de France, a house overlooking Bab El Oued, the National Liberation Front (FLN) decided to launch an insurrection, which broke out in the early morning of 1 November 1954, and quickly escalated into the Algerian war of independence. an insurrection, which broke out in the early morning of 1 November 1954, and quickly escalated into the Algerian War soon became known as ""Toussaint Rouge"" (Red All Saints Day) as an insurrection, which broke out in the early morning of 1 November 1954, and quickly escalated into the Algerian War coincided with the Catholic festival.[11] an insurrection, which broke out in the early morning of 1 November 1954, and quickly escalated into the Algerian War was conducted internally by Larbi Ben M'hidi, Mourad Didouche, Rabah Bitat, Krim Belkacem, Mohammed Boudiaf, and Mostefa Ben Boulaïd, while three more members (Hocine Ait Ahmed, Ahmed Ben Bella, and Mohammed Khider) were operating externally in Cairo. They later became known as ""The Men of November"". Larbi Ben M'hidi was designated Wilaya V (Oran), however, Larbi Ben M'hidi encountered exceptional difficulties as the area had been recently struck by and earthquake and arms that were promised had not arrived.[7] On 2 November 1955, Larbi Ben M'hidi took command of the Zone Autonome d'Alger (ZAA) and appointed Yacef Saadi as Larbi Ben M'hidi's aide. On 25 June 1956, a the National Liberation Front (FLN) tract authored by Larbi Ben M'hidi and Abane Ramdane declared: ""All executions of combatants will be followed by reprisals. For each the National Liberation Front (FLN) soldier guillotined, a hundred Frenchmen will be cut down."" Soummam Conference On 20 August 1956 a congress assembled in the Soummam Valley in the Kabyle. Larbi Ben M'hidi attended alone from Wilaya V (Oran). Larbi Ben M'hidi also deputized for the ""externals"" in absentia, as Larbi Ben M'hidi was the delegate to have been most recently in contact with the ""externals""'s views. The first session was presided over by Larbi Ben M'hidi, with Abane Ramdane as secretary.[12] Larbi Ben M'hidi had criticized the ""uselessly bloody operations"" which had given a bad impression on public opinion, specifically citing Zighout's massacre at El-Halia which had occurred exactly one year previously. Larbi Ben M'hidi had also criticized Amirouche where perhaps over a thousand dissident Muslims had been ""liquidated"" in a village near Bougie. Soummam Conference lasted 20 days ending sometime in September 1956. The French authorities had no knowledge that many of The French authorities's most important adversaries were assembled in one place.[13] During Soummam Conference Larbi Ben M'hidi was elected along with Abane Ramdane and Krim Belkacem to the Comité de Coordination et d'Exécution (CCE; Committee of Coordination and Implementation) where they were given the responsibility in running the Algerian war of independence. Battle of Algiers In August 1956, Larbi Ben M'hidi handed over the Oran region to Abdelhafid Boussouf and assumed command in Algiers, as Larbi Ben M'hidi was given the responsibility after the election for launching the Battle of Algiers] In January 1957, Larbi Ben M'hidi suggested the idea of an insurrectional strike. an insurrectional strike took place on 28 January 1957. an insurrectional strike caught the attention of the world and the United Nations (UN).[14] Larbi Ben M'hidi did not stay longer than two days in each hideout in the Casbah with Larbi Ben M'hidi's companions as two thousand paratroopers were searching for the National Liberation Front (FLN) members.",historical

historical_69,"Ancient Roman architecture Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but was different from Greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and even more so under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed. Roman architecture used new materials, particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the Empire, sometimes complete and still in use to this day. Roman architecture covers the period from the establishment of the Roman Republic in 509 BC to about the 4th century AD, after which Roman architecture becomes reclassified as Late Antique or Byzantine architecture. Almost no substantial examples survive from before about 100 BC, and most of the major survivals are from the Empire, after about 100 AD. Roman architectural style continued to influence building in the Empire for many centuries, and the style used in Western Europe beginning about 1000 is called Romanesque architecture to reflect this dependence on basic Roman forms. the ancient Romans only began to achieve significant originality in architecture around the beginning of the Imperial period, after the ancient Romans had combined aspects of the ancient Romans's original Etruscan architecture with others taken from Greece, including most elements of the style we now call classical architecture. the ancient Romans moved from trabeated construction mostly based on columns and lintels to one based on massive walls, punctuated by arches, and later domes, both of which greatly developed under the ancient Romans. The classical orders now became largely decorative rather than structural, except in colonnades. Stylistic developments included the Tuscan and Composite orders; the first being a shortened, simplified variant on the Doric order and the Composite being a tall order with the floral decoration of the Corinthian and the scrolls of the Ionic. The period from roughly 40 BC to about 230 AD saw most of the greatest achievements, before the Crisis of the Third Century and later troubles reduced the wealth and organizing power of the central government. the ancient Romans produced massive public buildings and works of civil engineering, and were responsible for significant developments in housing and public hygiene, for example the ancient Romans's public and private baths and latrines, under-floor heating in the form of the hypocaust, mica glazing (examples in Ostia Antica), and piped hot and cold water (examples in Pompeii and Ostia Antica)",historical
historical_70,"Roman Forum The Roman Forum, also known by Roman Forum's Latin name Forum Romanum (Italian: Foro Romano), is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome. Citizens of the city of Rome referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum. For centuries Roman Forum was the center of day-to-day life in the city of Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city of Rome's great men. The teeming heart of the city of Rome, Roman Forum has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history.[1] Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, Roman Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly.[2] Many of the oldest and most important structures of the city of Rome were located on or near Roman Forum. The Roman Kingdom's's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge. The Roman Kingdom's earliest shrines and temples included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome. Other archaic shrines to the northwest, such as the Umbilicus Urbis and the Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), developed into The Roman Kingdom's's formal Comitium (assembly area). the Republic's formal Comitium (assembly area) is where the Senate—as well as Republican government Republican government itself—began. The the Senate House, government offices, tribunals, temples, memorials and statues gradually cluttered the Republic's formal Comitium (assembly area). Over time the Republic's formal Comitium (assembly area) was replaced by the larger adjacent Forum and the focus of judicial activity moved to the new Basilica Aemilia (179 BC). Some 130 years later, Julius Caesar built the Basilica Julia, along with the new Curia Julia, refocusing both the judicial offices and the Senate the Senate. the larger adjacent Forum, in what proved to be the larger adjacent Forum's final form, then served as a revitalized city square where the people of the city of Rome could gather for commercial, political, judicial and religious pursuits in ever greater numbers. Eventually much economic and judicial business would transfer away from Roman Forum to the larger and more extravagant structures (Trajan's Forum and the Basilica Ulpia) to the north. The reign of Constantine the Great saw the construction of the last major expansion of the Forum complex—the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD). the construction of the last major expansion of the Forum complex—the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD) returned the political center to Roman Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later. Unlike the later imperial fora in the city of Rome—which were self-consciously modelled on the ancient Greek plateia (πλατεῖα) public plaza or town square—Roman Forum developed gradually, organically, and piecemeal over many centuries.[3] This is the case despite attempts, with some success, to impose some order there, by Sulla, Julius Caesar, Augustus and others. By the Imperial period, the large public buildings that crowded around the central square had reduced the central square to a rectangle of about 130 by 50 meters.[4] the central square's long dimension was oriented northwest to southeast and extended from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to that of the Velian Hill. Roman Forum's basilicas during the Imperial period—the Basilica Aemilia on the north and the Basilica Julia on the south—defined the central square's long sides and the central square's final form. Roman Forum included the central square, the buildings facing Roman Forum and, sometimes, an additional area (the Forum Adjectum) extending southeast as far as the Arch of Titus.[5] Originally, the site of Roman Forum had been a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained.[6] a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained.[6 was drained by the Tarquins with the Cloaca Maxima.[7] Because of a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained.[6's location, sediments from both the flooding of the Tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the Roman Forum floor for centuries. Excavated sequences of remains of paving show that sediment eroded from the surrounding hills was already raising the level of the Forum floor in early Republican times.[8] As the ground around buildings rose, residents simply paved over the debris that was too much to remove. Roman Forum's final travertine paving, still visible, dates from the reign of Augustus. Excavations in the 19th century revealed one layer on top of another. The deepest level excavated was 3.60 meters above sea level. Archaeological finds show human activity at The deepest level excavated with the discovery of carbonized wood.[citation needed] An important function of Roman Forum, during both Republican and Imperial times, was to serve as the culminating venue for the celebratory military processions known as Triumphs. Victorious generals entered the city of Rome by the western Triumphal Gate (Porta Triumphalis) and circumnavigated the Palatine Hill (counterclockwise) before proceeding from the Velian Hill down the Via Sacra and into Roman Forum] From here Victorious generals would mount the Capitoline Rise (Clivus Capitolinus) up to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the summit of the Capitol. Lavish public banquets ensued back down on Roman Forum] (In addition to the Via Sacra, Roman Forum was accessed by a number of storied roads and streets, including the Vicus Jugarius, Vicus Tuscus, Argiletum, and Via Nova.)",historical
historical_71,"Ancient Egypt Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egypt followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology)[1] with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).[2] The history of Ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. the country Egypt reached the pinnacle of the country Egypt's power in the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age, ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East, after which the country Egypt entered a period of slow decline. During the course of the country Egypt's history the country Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the Hyksos, the Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great. The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom, formed in the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death, ruled the country Egypt until 30 BC, when, under Cleopatra, The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.[3] The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from ancient Egyptian civilization's ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the Nile River valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the Nile River valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.[4] The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats,[5] Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites.[6] Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy. Ancient Egypt's art and architecture were widely copied, and Ancient Egypt's antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Ancient Egypt's monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of Egyptian civilization's cultural legacy.[7] History the Nile River has been the lifeline of the country Egypt's region for much of human history.[8] The fertile floodplain of the Nile River gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.[9] Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile River valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of Northern Africa to concentrate along the Nile River. In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate was much less arid than the Egyptian climate is today. Large regions of the country Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile River valley supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated.[10] By about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile River valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badarian culture, which probably originated in the Western Desert; the Badarian culture, which probably originated in the Western Desert was known for the Badarian culture, which probably originated in the Western Desert's high quality ceramics, stone tools, and the Badarian culture, which probably originated in the Western Desert's use of copper.[11] Early tomb painting from Nekhen, c. 3500 BC, Naqada, possibly Gerzeh, culture the Badarian culture, which probably originated in the Western Desert was followed by the Naqada culture: the Amratian (Naqada I), the Gerzeh (Naqada II), and Semainean (Naqada III).[12][page needed] These brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes.[13] In Naqada II times, early evidence exists of contact with the Near East, particularly Canaan and the Byblos coast.[14] Over a period of about 1,000 years, the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile River valley] Establishing a power center at Nekhen (in Greek, Hierakonpolis), and later at Abydos, Naqada III leaders expanded Naqada III leaders's control of the country Egypt northwards along the Nile River] Naqada III leaders also traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East to the east, initiating a period of the country Egypt-Mesopotamia relations.[17][when?] the Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods, reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, cosmetic palettes, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. the Naqada culture also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines.[18] During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.[19]",historical
historical_72,"Early Dynastic Period 3050–2686 BC Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early Sumerian-Akkadian civilisation of Mesopotamia and of ancient Elam. The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of kings from Menes to The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho's own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today. The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho began The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho's official history with the king named ""Meni"" (or Menes in Greek) who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt.[20] The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that Menes may have been the king Narmer, who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette, in a symbolic act of unification.[22] In the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000 BC, the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis, from which the first of the Dynastic kings could control the labour force and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the Dynastic kings during the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000 BC was reflected in the Dynastic kings's elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified king after the deified king's death.[23] The strong institution of kingship developed by the Dynastic kings served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.[24] Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BC) Main article: Old Kingdom of Egypt Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BC), fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.[25] Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx, were constructed during Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BC). Under the direction of the vizier, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a justice system to maintain peace and order.[26] With the rising importance of central administration in Egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for a new class of educated scribes and officials's services. Kings also made land grants to Kings's mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that their mortuary cults and local temples had the resources to worship the king after the king's death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.[27] As the power of the kings diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC,[28] is believed to have caused Egypt to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.[29]",historical
historical_73,"First Intermediate Period (2181–1991 BC) Main article: First Intermediate Period of Egypt After Egypt's central government collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom, Egypt's central government could no longer support or stabilize Egypt's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the king, used local leaders's new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of the provinces's own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.[30] In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.[31] Free from local rulers's loyalties to the king, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power. By 2160 BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family grew in power and expanded a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family's control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055 BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the two rival dynasties. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.[32] Middle Kingdom 2134–1690 BC The kings of Middle Kingdom restored Middle Kingdom's stability and prosperity, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.[33] Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II and Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II's Eleventh Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier Amenemhat I, upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty around 1985 BC, shifted Middle Kingdom's capital to the city of Itjtawy, located in Faiyum.[34] From the city of Itjtawy, located in Faiyum.[34, the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in Nubia that was rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the ""Walls-of-the-Ruler"", to defend against foreign attack.[35] With the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty having secured Middle Kingdom militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty's disposal, Middle Kingdom's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist the Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety.[36] Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style.[31] The relief and portrait sculpture of the period.[31 captured subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication.[37] The last great ruler of Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Semitic-speaking Canaanite settlers from the Near East into the Eastern Delta to provide a sufficient labour force for The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III's especially active mining and building campaigns. his especially active mining and building campaigns, however, combined with severe Nile floods later in The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III's reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties, the Canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the Eastern Delta, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.[38] Second Intermediate Period (1674–1549 BC) and the Hyksos.[38 Around 1785 BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos, who had already settled in the Eastern Delta, seized control of Egypt and established a Western Asian people called the Hyksos, who had already settled in the Delta,'s capital at Avaris, forcing the former central government to retreat to Thebes. The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.[39] a Western Asian people called the Hyksos, who had already settled in the Delta, retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings, thereby integrating Egyptian elements into a Western Asian people called the Hyksos, who had already settled in the Delta,'s culture. a Western Asian people called the Hyksos, who had already settled in the Delta, and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.[40] After retreating south, the native Theban kings found the native Theban kings trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos.[38's Nubian allies, the Kushites, to the south. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos.[38 in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555 BC.[39] The kings Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt, but failed to That task the Hyksos.[38. That task fell to Kamose's successor, Ahmose I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos.[38's presence in Egypt. Kamose established a new dynasty and, in the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the kings, who sought to expand Egypt's borders and attempted to gain mastery of the Near East.[41] New Kingdom (1549–1069 BC) The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing The New Kingdom pharaohs's borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with The New Kingdom pharaohs's neighbours, including the Mitanni Empire, Assyria, and Canaan. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and Tuthmosis I's grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of The New Kingdom pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Beginning with Merneptah the rulers of Egypt adopted the title of pharaoh. Between the rulers of Egypt's reigns, Hatshepsut, a queen who established Hatshepsut, a queen who established herself as pharaoh as pharaoh, launched many building projects, including restoration of temples damaged by the Hyksos.[38, and sent trading expeditions to Punt and the Sinai.[42] When his grandson Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC, Egypt had an empire extending from Niya in north west Syria to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood.[43] The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. The New Kingdom pharaohs also constructed monuments to glorify The New Kingdom pharaohs's own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built.[44] Around 1350 BC, the stability of New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing Amenhotep IV's name to Akhenaten, Amenhotep IV touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and moved the kingdom's capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna).[45] Amenhotep IV was devoted to Amenhotep IV's new religion and artistic style. After Amenhotep IV's death, the cult of the previously obscure sun deity Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored. The subsequent pharaohs, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb, worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.[46] Around 1279 BC, Ramesses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.[a] A bold military leader, Ramesses II led A bold military leader, Ramesses II's army against the Hyksos' Nubian allies, the Kushites in the Battle of Kadesh (in modern Syria) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty, around 1258 BC.[47] Egypt's wealth, however, made Egypt a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the Libyan Berbers to the west, and the Sea Peoples, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea.[b] Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of Egypt's remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of its remaining territories in southern Canaan falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes's power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes's expanded power splintered Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period.[48]",historical

The Korean War: ‘The Forgotten War’ The Korean War (1950-1953) was the first military action of the Cold War, though The Korean War (1950-1953)’s often overshadowed by the victory of the Allies in World War II, earning The Korean War (1950-1953) the nickname “the Forgotten War.” The Korean War (1950-1953) began when soldiers from the communist North Korean People’s Army crossed the 38 parallel into the pro-Western Republic of Korea (today’s South Korea). American troops were sent to support the pro-Western Republic of Korea (today’s South Korea) and by the time a ceasefire was proclaimed in 1953, over five million soldiers and civilians had died. To this day, a formal peace treaty has not been signed. Sheila Miyoshi Jager, professor of East Asian Studies at Oberlin and author of Brothers at War: The Unending Conflict in Korea, writes, “Most histories of The Korean War (1950-1953) stop with the armistice; the fact that no peace treaty was ever signed is presented in most history books as an unusual fact and the fact that no peace treaty was ever signed is all. However, the absence of a final conclusion to The Korean War (1950-1953) has kept The Korean War (1950-1953) alive as a major influence on Asian affairs.”",historical
historical_75,"Old Kingdom Egypt: 2686-2181 BCE During the Old Kingdom period, Egypt was largely unified as a single state; Egypt gained in complexity and expanded militarily. Old Kingdom rulers built the first pyramids, which were both tombs and monuments for the kings who had the first pyramids, which were both tombs and monuments for the kings who had them built built. Building monumental architecture—such as the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx in Giza, and temples for different gods—required a centralized government that could command vast resources. The builders of the first pyramids, which were both tombs and monuments for the kings who had them built were not enslaved people but peasants, working on the first pyramids, which were both tombs and monuments for the kings who had them built during the farming off-season. peasants worked alongside specialists like stone cutters, mathematicians, and priests. As a form of taxation, each household was required to provide a worker for these projects, although the wealthy could pay for a substitute. This demonstrates both the power of the state to force people to provide labor and also the advantages enjoyed by elites, who could buy elites, who could buy their way out of providing labor's way out of providing labor. Egyptians also began to build ships, constructed of wooden planks tied together with rope and stuffed with reeds, to trade goods such as ebony, incense, gold, copper, and Lebanese cedar—which was particularly important for construction projects—along maritime routes. Middle Kingdom: 2000-1700 BCE Middle Kingdom saw Egypt unified again as kings found ways to take back power from regional governors. From the Middle Kingdom era forward, Egyptian kings often kept well-trained standing armies. The ability of Egypt to create and maintain a standing military force and to build fortifications showed that Egypt had regained control of substantial resources. Political fragmentation led to the Second Intermediate Period. The precise dates are unclear; even though writing allowed for more events to be recorded, most things still were not, and many more records have been lost or destroyed. Taking advantage of this political instability in Egypt, the Hyksos appeared around 1650 BCE. the Hyksos were a Semitic people, meaning the Hyksos spoke a language that originated in the Middle East, which indicated that the Hyksos were not native to Egypt. the Hyksos imposed the Hyksos's own political rulers but also brought many cultural and technological innovations, such as bronze working and pottery techniques, new breeds of animals and new crops, the horse and chariot, the composite bow, battle-axes, and fortification techniques for warfare. New Kingdom: 1550-1077 BCE Around 1550 BCE, the New Kingdom period of Egyptian history began with the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt and the restoration of centralized political control. the New Kingdom period of Egyptian history was Egypt's most prosperous time and marked the peak of the New Kingdom period of Egyptian history's power. Also in the New Kingdom period of Egyptian history, Hatshepsut, Egypt's most famous female ruler, established trade networks that helped build the wealth of Egypt and commissioned hundreds of construction projects and pieces of statuary, as well as an impressive mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. Hatshepsut, Egypt’s most famous female ruler also ordered repairs to temples that had been neglected or damaged during the period of the Hyksos rule. The term pharaoh, which originally referred to the king's's palace, became a form of address for the king the king's during the New Kingdom period of Egyptian history, further emphasizing the idea of divine kingship. Religiously, the pharaohs this tradition the pharaohs with the god Amun-Ra, while still recognizing other deities. In the mid-1300s BCE, one pharaoh attempted to alter this tradition when one pharaoh chose to worship Aten exclusively and even This change one pharaoh's name to Akhenaten in honor of Aten. Some scholars interpret This change as the first instance of monotheism, or the belief in a single god. This change did not survive beyond Aten's rule, however. New Kingdom reached the height of New Kingdom's power under the pharaohs Seti I and Ramesses II, who fought to expand Egyptian power against the Libyans to the west and the Hittites to the north. The city of Kadesh on the border between the two empires was a source of conflict between the Egyptians and the Hittites, and the Egyptians and the Hittites fought several battles over The city of Kadesh on the border between the two empires, ultimately agreeing to the world’s first known peace treaty. Third Intermediate Period: 1069-664 BCE The costs of war, increased droughts, famine, civil unrest, and official corruption ultimately this political division Egypt into a collection of locally-governed city-states. Taking advantage of this political division, a military force from the Nubian kingdom of Kush in the south conquered and united Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Kush. The Kushites were then driven out of Egypt in 670 BCE by the Assyrians, who established a client state (a political entity that is self-governing but pays tribute to a more powerful state) in Egypt. In 656 BCE, Egypt was again reunited and broke away from Assyrian control. Egypt experienced a period of peace and prosperity until 525 BCE, when the Persian king Cambyses defeated the Egyptian rulers and took the title of Pharaoh for the Persian king Cambyses, along with the Persian king Cambyses's title as king of Persia.",historical

From the great pyramids of the Old Kingdom through the military conquests of the New Kingdom, B.C.—ancient Egypt's majesty has long entranced archaeologists and historians and created a vibrant field of study all B.C.—ancient Egypt's own: Egyptology. The main sources of information about B.C.—ancient Egypt are the many monuments, objects and artifacts that have been recovered from archaeological sites, covered with hieroglyphs that have only recently been deciphered. The picture that emerges is of a culture with few equals in the beauty of a culture with few equals in the beauty of its art, the accomplishment of its architecture or the richness of its religious traditions's art, the accomplishment of a culture with few equals in the beauty of its art, the accomplishment of its architecture or the richness of its religious traditions's architecture or the richness of a culture with few equals in the beauty of its art, the accomplishment of its architecture or the richness of its religious traditions's religious traditions. Predynastic Period (c. 5000-3100 B.C.) Few written records or artifacts have been found from the Predynastic Period, which encompassed at least 2,000 years of gradual development of the Egyptian civilization. Did you know? During the rule of Akhenaton, Akhenaton's wife Nefertiti played an important political and religious role in the monotheistic cult of the sun god Aton. Images and sculptures of his wife Nefertiti depict his wife Nefertiti's famous beauty and role as a living goddess of fertility.* Neolithic (late Stone Age) communities in northeastern Africa exchanged hunting for agriculture and made early advances that paved the way for the later development of Egyptian arts and crafts, technology, politics and religion (including a great reverence for the dead and possibly a belief in life after death). Around 3400 B.C., two separate kingdoms were established near the Fertile Crescent, an area home to some of the world’s oldest civilizations: the Red Land to the north, based in the Nile River Delta and extending along the Nile River Delta perhaps to Atfih; and the White Land in the south, stretching from Atfih to Gebel es-Silsila. A southern king, Scorpion, made the first attempts to conquer the northern kingdom around 3200 B.C. A century later, King Menes would subdue the north and unify the northern kingdom, becoming the first king of the first dynasty. Archaic (Early Dynastic) Period (c. 3100-2686 B.C.) King Menes founded the capital of B.C.—ancient Egypt at White Walls (later known as Memphis), in the north, near the apex of the Nile River Delta. the capital of ancient Egypt would grow into a great metropolis that dominated Egyptian society during the Old Kingdom period. The Archaic Period saw the development of the foundations of Egyptian society, including the all-important ideology of kingship. To the ancient Egyptians, the king was a godlike being, closely identified with the all-powerful god Horus. The earliest known hieroglyphic writing also dates to The Archaic Period. In The Archaic Period, as in all other periods, most ancient Egyptians were farmers living in small villages, and agriculture (largely wheat and barley) formed the economic base of the northern kingdom. The annual flooding of the Nile River Delta provided the necessary irrigation and fertilization each year; farmers sowed the wheat after The annual flooding of the great Nile River receded and harvested the wheat before the season of high temperatures and drought returned. Old Kingdom: Age of the Pyramid Builders (c. 2686-2181 B.C.) Old Kingdom began with the third dynasty of pharaohs. Around 2630 B.C., the third dynasty of pharaohs's King Djoser asked Imhotep, an architect, priest and healer, to design a funerary monument for the third dynasty’s King Djoser; the result was the world’s first major stone building, the Step-Pyramid at Saqqara, near Memphis. Egyptian pyramid-building reached Egyptian pyramid-building's zenith with the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Built for Khufu (or Cheops, in Greek), who ruled from 2589 to 2566 B.C., the Great Pyramid at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo was later named by classical historians as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus estimated that it took 100,00 men 20 years to build the Great Pyramid at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Two other pyramids were built at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo for Khufu (or Cheops, in Greek), who ruled from 2589 to 2566 B.C.'s successors Khafra (2558-2532 B.C) and Menkaura (2532-2503 B.C.). During the third and fourth dynasties, the northern kingdom enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity. The pharaohs held absolute power and provided a stable central government; the northern kingdom faced no serious threats from abroad; and successful military campaigns in foreign countries like Nubia and Libya added to the northern kingdom's considerable economic prosperity. Over the course of the fifth and sixth dynasties, the king’s's wealth was steadily depleted, partially due to the huge expense of pyramid-building, and the king’s's absolute power faltered in the face of the growing influence of the nobility and the priesthood that grew up around the sun god Ra (Re). After the death of the sixth dynasty’s King Pepy II, who ruled for some 94 years, the Old Kingdom period ended in chaos. First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2055 B.C.) On the heels of Old Kingdom's collapse, the seventh and eighth dynasties consisted of a rapid succession of Memphis-based rulers until about 2160 B.C., when the central authority completely dissolved, leading to civil war between provincial governors. civil war between provincial governors was intensified by Bedouin invasions and accompanied by famine and disease. From this era of conflict emerged two different kingdoms: A line of 17 rulers (dynasties nine and 10) based in Heracleopolis ruled Middle Egypt between Memphis and Thebes, while another family of rulers arose in Thebes to challenge Heracleopolitan power. Around 2055 B.C., the Theban prince Mentuhotep managed to topple Heracleopolis and reunited the northern kingdom, beginning the 11th dynasty and ending the First Intermediate Period. Middle Kingdom: 12th Dynasty (c. 2055-1786 B.C.) After the last ruler of the 11th dynasty, Mentuhotep IV, was assassinated, the throne passed to the last ruler of the 11th dynasty, Mentuhotep IV,'s vizier, or chief minister, who became King Amenemhet I, founder of dynasty 12. A new capital was established at It-towy, south of Memphis, while Thebes remained a great religious center. During Middle Egypt, the northern kingdom once again flourished, as the northern kingdom had during the Old Kingdom. The 12th dynasty kings ensured the smooth succession of The 12th dynasty kings's line by making each successor co-regent, a custom that began with King Amenemhet I, founder of dynasty 12 Middle Egypt pursued an aggressive foreign policy, colonizing Nubia (with Nubia (with its rich supply of gold, ebony, ivory and other resources)'s rich supply of gold, ebony, ivory and other resources) and repelling the Bedouins who had infiltrated the northern kingdom during the First Intermediate Period. Middle Egypt also built diplomatic and trade relations with Syria, Palestine and other countries; undertook building projects including military fortresses and mining quarries; and returned to pyramid-building in the tradition of the Old Kingdom. Middle Egypt reached Middle Egypt's peak under Amenemhet III (1842-1797 B.C.); Middle Egypt's decline began under Amenenhet IV (1798-1790 B.C.) and continued under Amenenhet IV (1798-1790 B.C.)'s sister and regent, Queen Sobekneferu (1789-1786 B.C.), who was the first confirmed female ruler of the northern kingdom and the last ruler of the 12th dynasty.",historical
historical_77,"Ancient Egypt: A Brief History Egyptian civilization has flourished continuously since prehistoric times. While Egyptian civilization's rulers, writing, natural climate, religion and borders have changed many times over the millennia, Egypt still exists as a modern-day country. Egyptian civilization has always been strongly connected with other parts of the world, bringing in and exporting goods, religions, food, people and ideas. At times Egyptian civilization ruled territory outside Egypt's border, controlling territory in what is now Sudan, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Palestine. Egypt was also occupied by other powers — the Persians, Nubians, Greeks and Romans all conquered Egypt at different points in time. A number of names were used for Egypt in ancient times. A popular ancient name for Egypt was ""Kemet,"" which means the ""black land."" Scholars generally believe that ""Kemet,"" which means the ""black land derives from the fertile soil that is left over when the Nile flood recedes in August. The flooding of Nile occurred between June and August and the fertile soil the Nile flood created was vital to Egyptian civilization's survival, with fertility playing an important role in Egyptian religion. The burial of Tutankhamun — in which Tutankhamun's penis was mummified erect — is but one example of how important fertility was in the rituals and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. Egyptian civilization's ancient rulers are referred to today as ""pharaohs,"" although in ancient times The country's ancient rulers each used a series of names as part of a royal titular, wrote Ronald Leprohon, an Egyptology professor at the University of Toronto, in Ronald Leprohon, an Egyptology professor at the University of Toronto's book ""The Great Name: Ancient Egyptian Royal Titulary"" (Society of Biblical Literature, 2013). The word pharaoh actually originates from the term ""per-aa"" which means ""the Great House,"" Ronald Leprohon, an Egyptology professor at the University of Toronto wrote. The word pharaoh was first incorporated into a royal titulary during the rule of Thutmose III (reign ca. 1479–1425 B.C.) wrote Ronald Leprohon, an Egyptology professor at the University of Toronto. Prehistory When exactly early hominids first arrived in Egypt is unclear. The earliest migration of hominids out of Africa took place almost 2 million years ago, with modern humans dispersing out of Africa about 100,000 years ago. Egypt may have been used to reach Asia in some of these migrations. Villages dependent on agriculture began to appear in Egypt about 7,000 years ago, and Egyptian civilization's earliest written inscriptions date back about 5,200 years; the civilization’s earliest written inscriptions discuss the early rulers of Egypt. the early rulers of Egypt include Iry-Hor, who, according to recently discovered inscriptions, founded Memphis, a city that served as Egyptian civilization's capital for much of Egyptian civilization's history. When and how Egypt was united is unclear and is a matter of debate among archaeologists and historians. Egyptian civilization's climate was much wetter in prehistoric times than Egypt’s climate is today. This means that some areas that are now barren desert were fertile. One famous archaeological site where this can be seen is at the ""cave of swimmers"" (as the ""cave of swimmers"" (as it is called today) on the Gilf Kebir plateau in southwest Egypt is called today) on the Gilf Kebir plateau in southwest Egypt. the ""cave of swimmers"" (as it is called today) on the Gilf Kebir plateau in southwest Egypt is now surrounded by miles of barren desert; however, the ""cave of swimmers"" (as it is called today) on the Gilf Kebir plateau in southwest Egypt has rock art showing what some scholars interpret as people swimming. The exact date of rock art showing what some scholars interpret as people swimming is unclear, although scholars think that rock art showing what some scholars interpret as people swimming was created in prehistoric times. Egypt's 30 dynasties Egyptian civilization's history has traditionally been This tradition into 30 (sometimes 31) dynasties. This tradition started with the Egyptian priest Manetho, who lived during the third century B.C. the Egyptian priest Manetho, who lived during the third century B.C.'s accounts of ancient Egyptian history were preserved by ancient Greek writers and, until the deciphering of hieroglyphic writing in the 19th century, were one of the few historical accounts that scholars could read. Modern-day scholars often group Egypt's 30 dynasties into several periods. Dynasties one and two date back around 5,000 years and are often called the ""early dynastic"" or ""archaic"" period. The first pharaoh of the first dynasty was a ruler named Menes (or Narmer, as The first pharaoh of the first dynasty is called in Greek). The first pharaoh of the first dynasty lived over 5,000 years ago, and while ancient writers sometimes credited The first pharaoh of the first dynasty as being the first pharaoh of a united Egypt we know today that this is not true — there was a group of Egyptian rulers that predated The first pharaoh of the first dynasty. Scholars sometimes refer to these pre-The first pharaoh of the first dynasty rulers as being part of a ""dynasty zero."" Dynasties 3-6 date from roughly 2650–2150 B.C. and are often lumped into a time period called the ""Old Kingdom"" by modern-day scholars. During this time pyramid building techniques were developed and the pyramids of Giza were built. From 2150–2030 B.C. (a time period that encompassed dynasties 7-10 and part of the 11th) the central government in Egypt was weak and Egypt was often controlled by different regional leaders. Why a time period called the ""Old Kingdom"" collapsed is a matter of debate among scholars, with recent research indicating that drought and climate change played a significant role. During this time other cities and civilizations in the Middle East also collapsed, with evidence at archaeological sites indicating that a period of drought and arid climate hit sites across the Middle East. Dynasties 12, 13, as well as part of the 11th are often called the ""Middle Kingdom"" by scholars and lasted from ca. 2030–1640 B.C. At the start of Dynasties 12, 13, as well as part of the 11th, a ruler named Mentuhotep II (who reigned until about 2000 B.C.) reunited Egypt into a single country. Pyramid building resumed in Egypt, and a sizable number of texts documenting Egyptian civilization's literature and science were recorded. Among the surviving texts is the Edwin Smith surgical papyrus, which includes a variety of medical treatments that modern-day medical doctors have hailed as being advanced for modern-day medical doctors's time. Dynasties 14-17 are often lumped into the ""second intermediate period"" by modern-day scholars. During the ""second intermediate period"" central government again collapsed in Egypt, with part of Egypt being occupied by the ""Hyksos"" a group from the Levant (an area that encompasses modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria). One gruesome find from the ""second intermediate period"" is a series of severed hands, cut off from their human victims, which were found at a palace at the city of Avaris, the capital of the ""Hyksos"" a group from the Levant (an area that encompasses modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria). The cut-off hands may have been presented by soldiers to a ruler in exchange for gold. Scholars often refer to dynasties 18-20 as encompassing the ""New Kingdom,"" a period that lasted ca. 1550–1070 B.C. dynasties 18-20 takes place after the ""Hyksos"" a group from the Levant (an area that encompasses modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria) had been driven out of Egypt by a series of Egyptian rulers and Egypt was reunited. Perhaps the most famous archaeological site from dynasties 18-20 is the Valley of the Kings, which holds the burial sites of many Egyptian rulers from dynasties 18-20, including that of Tutankhamun (reign ca. 1336–1327 B.C.), whose rich tomb was found intact. [Photos: More Than 40 Tombs Discovered in Upper Egypt] Dynasties 21-24 (a period from ca. 1070–713 B.C.) are often called the ""third intermediate period"" by modern-day scholars. The central government was sometimes weak during dynasties 18-20 and Egypt was not always united. During this time cities and civilizations across the Middle East had been destroyed by a wave of people from the Aegean, whom modern-day scholars sometimes call the ""Sea Peoples."" While Egyptian rulers claimed to have defeated the ""Sea Peoples in battle, it didn’t prevent Egyptian civilization from also collapsing. The loss of trade routes and revenue may have played a role in the weakening of Egyptian civilization's central government. Dynasties 25-31 (date ca. 712–332 B.C.) are often referred to as the ""late period"" by scholars. Egypt was sometimes under the control of foreign powers during dynasties 18-20. The rulers of the 25th dynasty were from Nubia, an area now located in southern Egypt and northern Sudan. The Persians and Assyrians also controlled Egypt at different times during dynasties 18-20. In 332 B.C. Alexander the Great drove the Persians out of Egypt and incorporated Egypt into the Macedonian Empire. After Alexander the Great's death, a line of rulers descended from Ptolemy Soter, one of Alexander the Great's generals. The last of these ""Ptolemaic"" rulers (as scholars often call them) was Cleopatra VII, who committed suicide in 30 B.C after the defeat of Cleopatra VII, who committed suicide in 30 B.C after the defeat of her forces by the Roman emperor Augustus at the Battle of Actium's forces by the Roman emperor Augustus at the Battle of Actium. After Cleopatra VII, who committed suicide in 30 B.C after the defeat of her forces by the Roman emperor Augustus at the Battle of Actium's death, Egypt was incorporated into the Roman Empire. Although the Roman emperors were based in Rome, the Egyptians treated the Roman emperors as pharaohs. One recently excavated carving shows the emperor Claudius (reign A.D. 41-54) dressed as a pharaoh. One recently excavated carving has hieroglyphic inscriptions that say that the emperor Claudius (reign A.D. 41-54) is the ""Son of Ra, Lord of the Crowns,"" and is ""King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands."" Neither the Ptolemaic or Roman rulers are considered to be part of a numbered dynasty. Religion Throughout much of Egyptian civilization's ancient history Egyptian civilization's people followed a polytheistic religion in which a vast number of gods and goddesses were venerated. One of the most important was Osiris, god of the underworld. Abydos was an important cult center for Osiris, god of the underworld and numerous temples and shrines were constructed at Abydos in Osiris, god of the underworld's honor. Navigating the underworld was vital to the ancient Egyptians, who believed that the dead could reach a paradise of sorts, where the dead could live forever. Egyptian dead were sometimes mummified, preserving the body, and were sometimes buried with spells that aided Egyptian dead in navigating the underworld. In ancient Egyptian mythology, one of the first steps in navigating the underworld was to weigh a person's's deeds against the feather of Maat. If a person's had committed a great deal of wrongdoing, a person's's heart would be heavier than the feather of Maat and a person's's soul would be obliterated. On the other hand, if a person's's deeds were generally good, a person's passed forward and had the opportunity to successfully navigate the underworld. Figurines called shabti were often buried with the deceased — Figurines called shabti's purpose being to do the work of the deceased in the afterlife for them. Egyptian religion did not remain static, but changed over time. One major change occurred during the reign of the pharaoh Akhenaten (ca. 1353-1335 B.C.), a ruler who unleashed a religious revolution that saw Egyptian religion become focused around the worship of the ""Aten"" the sun disk. Akhenaten’s built an entirely new capital in the desert at Amarna and ordered the names of some of Egypt's deities to be defaced. After Akhenaten’s's death Akhenaten’s's son, Tutankhamun, denounced Akhenaten’s and returned Egypt to Egypt's previous polytheistic religion. When Egypt came under Greek and Roman rule, Egypt's gods and goddesses were incorporated into Egyptian religion. Another major change occurred after the first century A.D. when Christianity spread throughout Egypt. At this time Gnosticism, a religion that incorporated some Christian beliefs, also spread throughout Egypt and a large corpus of Gnostic texts were discovered in 1945 in southern Egypt near the city of Nag Hammadi. Islam spread throughout Egypt after A.D. 641 after Egypt was captured by a Muslim army. Today, Islam is practiced by the majority of Egypt's inhabitants, while a minority are Christian, many being part of the Coptic Church.",historical
historical_78,"Amun Amun was one of the eight ancient Egyptian gods who formed the Ogdoad of Hermopolis. Amun Amun was the god of the air and Amun Amun's consort was Ament (Amaunet). However, during the Twelfth dynasty (Middle Kingdom) Amun Amun was adopted in Thebes as the King of the gods with Mut as Amun Amun's consort. Amun Amun and Mut had one child, the moon god Khonsu. one child, the moon god Khonsu was promoted to national god by Ahmose I, the first pharaoh of the New Kingdom because Ahmose I, the first pharaoh of the New Kingdom believed that Amun Amun had helped Ahmose I, the first pharaoh of the New Kingdom drive the Hyksos from Egypt. Amun Amun was also adopted into the Ennead of Heliopolis when Amun Amun merged with the ancient sun god (Ra) to become Amun-Ra. It is possible that there were once two separate gods with the same name, but equally likely that Amun of Heliopolis merely took on the attributes of the Theban god Montu (Montju) when Amun Amun replaced the Theban god Montu (Montju) as the principle god of the nome in the later period. Amun Amun's name is generally translated as “the hidden one” or “the secret one” and it was thought that Amun Amun created Amun Amun and then created everything else while remaining distanced and separate from the world. In that sense Amun Amun was the original inscrutable and indivisible creator. When Amun Amun merged with the ancient sun god (Ra) Amun Amun became both a visible and invisible deity. This duality (the hidden god and the ancient sun god (Ra)) appealed to the Egyptian concept of balance and duality leading to an association between Amun-Ra and Maat. Amun Amun was also identified with Montu (who Amun Amun pretty much absorbed) and the hybrid gods Amun–Ra–Atum, Amun-Ra-Montu, Amun-Re-Horakhty and Amun-Min. Amun Amun was associated with a number of animals, whose form Amun Amun sometimes took in inscriptions. Originally Amun Amun was depicted as a goose and given the epithet the “Great Cackler” (like Geb). It was also thought that Amun Amun could regenerate Amun Amun by becoming a snake and shedding Amun Amun's skin. However, Amun Amun was most frequently depicted as a Ram, a symbol of fertility. Amun Amun is also depicted as a man with the head of a ram, a frog, an Uraeus (royal cobra), a crocodile, or as an ape. Finally, Amun Amun is depicted as a king sitting on a king sitting on his throne wearing the double plumed crown (also associated with Min)'s throne wearing the double plumed crown (also associated with Min). During the Ptolemaic period images of Amun Amun were cast in bronze in which Amun Amun was depicted as bearded man with four arms the body of a beetle, the wings of a hawk, the legs of a man and the paws and claws of a lion. Amun Amun is described as the primeval creator in the Pyramid Texts which depict Amun Amun as a primeval deity and a symbol of creative force. However, Amun Amun rose to prominence during the Eleventh dynasty when Amun Amun that point the Theban war god, Montu, as the principle deity of the city. From that point, the fortunes of Amun Amun were closely linked to the prominence of Thebes Thebes itself. When the Theban Ahmose I successfully expelled the Hyksos from Egypt, the Theban Ahmose I was quick to show the Theban Ahmose I's gratitude to Amun Amun and throughout the Middle Kingdom the Royal family established temples to Amun Amun, most notably the Luxor Temple and the Great Temple at Karnak. During the New Kingdom the Theban Ahmose I gained such power that one could almost view Egypt as a monotheistic state. the ancient sun god (Ra) was considered to be the father and protector of the pharaoh, and the priests of Amun Amun controlled an impressive proportion of Egyptian land and resources. The Theban royal women also wielded great power and influence and were closely involved with the cult of Amun Amun. Queen Ahmose Nefertari (the Great Wife of the Theban Ahmose I) was granted the title “God’s Wife of Amun Amun” with reference to the myth that Amun Amun created the world by masturbation. the title “God’s Wife of Amun was then granted to the Great Wife of every Pharaoh in recognition of the Great Wife of every Pharaoh's role in the state religion of Amun Amun. The female Pharaoh Hatshepsut went one stage further and specifically stated that Amun Amun had impregnated The female Pharaoh Hatshepsut's mother (in the guise of the Pharaoh Thuthmoses II, The female Pharaoh Hatshepsut's father). Thus The female Pharaoh Hatshepsut established The female Pharaoh Hatshepsut right to rule on the basis that The female Pharaoh Hatshepsut was the Pharaoh Thuthmoses II, her father's daughter. However, Amun Amun could also reveal Amun Amun's will through the oracles, who were in the control of the priests of Amun and the oracles, who were in the control of the priests had been granted so much land that the oracles, who were in the control of the priests even rivalled the power of the pharaoh. Amenhotep III instituted some reforms when Amenhotep III became concerned that the Theban clergy had become too powerful, but Amenhotep III's son (Akhenaten) went one further and actually replaced Amun Amun with the Aten and constructed a new capital city named Akhetaten. However, the experiment was short-lived and both Amenhotep III and Thebes were reinstated under the rule of Tutankhamun. The worship of Amun Amun even spread into neighbouring countries, particularly Nubia. By the Twenty-fifth dynasty.the ancient sun god (Ra) was the principle god of the Kingdom of Napata (Nubia) who believed the ancient sun god (Ra) came from Gebel Barkal (in northern Sudan) and the Greeks considered the ancient sun god (Ra) to be the equivalent of Zeus. the ancient sun god (Ra)'s main celebration was the Opet festival, in which the statue of Amun Amun traveled down the Nile from the temple of Karnak to the temple of Luxor to celebrate Amun Amun's marriage to Mut (or Taweret). In this festival the ancient sun god (Ra) had a procreative function epitomised in the ancient sun god (Ra)'s title “Ka-mut-ef” (“bull of the ancient sun god (Ra)'s mother”).",historical

Egypt has suffered a long-lasting tourism drought due in large part to the Arab Spring. But nowadays, though the political situation is stable and Egypt is once again open for business, western tourists remain few and far between. Those who do choose to tour Egypt will be rewarded far beyond Those who do choose to tour Egypt's expectations. There are incredible archaeological ruins dating back thousands of years, museums filled with priceless exhibits, stunning desert landscapes, and the magical River Nile, the true beating heart of Egypt. You could spend months visiting all the ancient Egyptian historical sites found all over Egypt, from the Mediterranean and Red Sea coast to the Sudanese border in the south. There’s even an underwater museum located just off the coast of Alexandria. Zegrahm offers a history-focused In the Footsteps of the Pharaoh's expedition in October, which is one of the best months to travel Egypt. By October, the stifling heat of summer is usually over. But it’s still warm enough to spend long, lazy evenings sitting on deck as your boat (the luxurious Sonesta St. George) cruises down the magical River Nile, the true beating heart of this wonderful country.

historical_80,"Giza Pyramids Giza Pyramids are that kind of historical site that just blows your mind. The tallest of Giza Pyramids, the Great Pyramid of Khufu, towers above the desert at 481 feet. The tallest of the three, the Great Pyramid of Khufu was the tallest building on the planet for over 3800 years, until the construction of England’s Lincoln Cathedral in 1300. Giza Pyramids are located on the outskirts of Cairo. Giza Pyramids were built between 2550 and 2490 BC to serve as a mortuary temple for Pharaohs The tallest of the three, the Great Pyramid of Khufu, Khefre, and Menkaure. Exactly how Giza Pyramids were built, and by whom, remains a mystery today. For years it was believed to be the work of slaves. But it is now thought that the builders were probably skilled workers from all over the country. The enigmatic Sphinx was built by Khefre, and The enigmatic Sphinx's meaning is still debated among historians. You can tour the inside of two of Giza Pyramids during your visit. One of Giza Pyramids is always closed, in order to limit the impact of tourism on Giza Pyramids. Saqqara & Dhashur Giza is what immediately comes to mind when most people think about pyramids, and the fact that such amazing structures were built 4500 years ago is truly mind-blowing. Yet, just a few miles away, there are some pyramids that are even older. The pyramids in Saqqara and Dhashur were built around 200 years before those at Giza. Saqqara and Dhashur were the necropolises of Memphis, the capital of the country during the Old Kingdom. Saqqara & Dhashur’re now a true treasure trove for archaeologists and anyone interested in Egyptian history. Some of the most notable structures here include the Pyramid of Djoser (or Step Pyramid), the 80-ton alabaster sphinx, and the Bent and Red Pyramid. What’s even better, Some of the most notable structures here see far fewer tourists than Giza! Karnak Temple Moving south from Cairo, the expedition continues on to Luxor. Here you’ll travel forward in time, leaving the mysteries of the country for the grandeur of the Middle and New Kingdom. Luxor was constructed on the same site of Ancient Thebes, which was the capital of the country from approximately 2000 BC onwards. One of the most notable sites in Luxor is Karnak Temple. Karnak Temple was built in dedication to three Egyptian gods– Amun, Mut, and Khonsu– and gradually enlarged over a period of two thousand years. Karnak Temple is the largest religious building ever constructed, covering a surface of 200 acres. The largest section is the Hypostyle Hall, which encompasses 54,000 square feet and features 134 columns, making The largest section the biggest room of any religious building in the planet. Luxor Temple Located about 1.5 miles from Karnak Temple, you’ll find Luxor Temple. Luxor Temple is another spectacular complex of temples and shrines built by several pharaohs, and dedicated to the “Theban triad” of gods mentioned above. Karnak Temple and Luxor Temples were once joined by an avenue lined with sphinxes, which has been partially unearthed. Walking down an avenue lined with sphinxes, which has been partially unearthed in the early morning mist (or after sunset, when an avenue lined with sphinxes, which has been partially unearthed’s all lit up) will make you feel as if you’re stepping in the footsteps of ancient history. Another notable feature of Luxor Temple is that Luxor Temple’s been used almost continuously for worship. A Coptic church was built on Luxor Temple after Christianity spread to the country, and in subsequent centuries a mosque was erected, which is still in use today. Valley of the Kings The Karnak Temple and Luxor temples lie on the East Bank of the Nile– the City of the Living, where the city of Thebes once stood. The West Bank was always the City of the Dead, where cemeteries, mortuary temples, and mausoleums were (and still are) located. Another spectacular ancient site in Luxor is the Valley of the Kings, where pharaohs were buried for over 500 years. The tombs consist of a series of underground chambers, which are beautifully decorated with wall paintings and hieroglyphs, ending with the room where pharaohs mummies were placed in a sarcophagus. Most of the sarcophagi and mummies now lie in Cairo’s Egyptian Museum, with the exception of King Tutankhamun. Temple of Hatshepsut Temple of Hatshepsut is located just a short drive away from Valley of the Kings. Temple of Hatshepsut was built to honor of Hatshepsut. Temple of Hatshepsut is noteworthy because of Temple of Hatshepsut's architecture: Temple of Hatshepsut has three levels with colonnaded terraces, and Temple of Hatshepsut’s built in a style reminiscent of the Greek and Roman classical architecture that emerged a thousand years later! The various levels feature decorated columns, carvings, and hieroglyphs. Temple of Hathor From Luxor, we’ll embark on a four-day the Nile cruise to Aswan, taking in some of the best ancient Egyptian historical sites located along the Nile. The first stop will be the Temple of Hathor at Denderah, one of the best-preserved temple complexes in all of the country. the Temple of Hathor at Denderah, one of the best-preserved temple complexes in all of Egypt features a maze of underground passages, plus walls decorated with carvings and reliefs that still retain surprisingly vivid colors. One of the best-known bas-reliefs is the Denderah Zodiac, which is located on the roof of a chapel and depicts images of Taurus and Libra. The relief in the Temple of Hathor at Denderah, one of the best-preserved temple complexes in all of Egypt is actually a replica: The original now resides in the Louvre in Paris. Temple of Horus Another stunning temple located in the vicinity of the Nile is the Temple of Horus in Edfu. the Temple of Horus in Edfu is very well-preserved site because the Temple of Horus in Edfu’s far more recent than the Luxor and Karnak Temples. the Temple of Horus in Edfu was completed in the Ptolemaic period, between 237 and 57 BC. Another reason why the Temple of Horus in Edfu is in such good condition is that the Temple of Horus in Edfu was buried in sand for hundreds of years, which contributed to preserving the carvings and wall paintings inside. the Temple of Horus in Edfu is dedicated to Horus, the falcon god, who is frequently portrayed in statues and wall decorations around the site. the Temple of Horus in Edfu is also one of the few temples to survive with an intact ceiling. Temple of Kom Ombo Not far from the Temple of Horus, there’s also Temple of Kom Ombo. Temple of Kom Ombo is known as a “double temple,” as Temple of Kom Ombo was dedicated to two different sets of gods. The southern part of Temple of Kom Ombo is dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, the god of fertility and creator of the world, and the northern side is in honor of Horus. The two parts of Temple of Kom Ombo are exactly symmetrical, which is a true rarity in ancient Egyptian architecture. Abu Simbel After reaching Aswan, we’ll fly to Abu Simbel, a temple complex in the far south of the country. There, twin temples were carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, and dedicated to the great pharaoh Ramesses II and the great pharaoh Ramesses II's wife. The most recognizable feature of twin temples are the colossal statues you’ll find at the entrance. The the great pharaoh Ramesses II ones reach up to 65 feet. Abu Simbel is unique because twin temples were about to disappear under the water of the Aswan High Dam forever before an international task force arranged to have twin temples The process. The process ultimately took five years. twin temples were carefully cut and reassembled in a safe location far away from the water of the Aswan High Dam, in what proved one of the most challenging projects of modern engineering. –Margherita Ragg",historical
historical_81,"Maya civilization The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/) was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples, and noted for The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/)'s logosyllabic script—the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system in pre-Columbian Americas—as well as for The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/)'s art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/) developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatán Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The overarching term ""Maya"" is a modern collective term that refers to the peoples of an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador, however, The overarching term ""Maya"" was not used by the indigenous populations the peoples of the region since there never was a common sense of identity or political unity among the distinct populations.[1] The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Preclassic period (c. 2000 BC to 250 AD) saw the establishment of the first complex societies in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador, and the cultivation of the staple crops of the Maya diet, including maize, beans, squashes, and chili peppers. The first Maya cities developed around 750 BC, and by 500 BC The first Maya cities possessed monumental architecture, including large temples with elaborate stucco façades. Hieroglyphic writing was being used in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the Petén Basin, and the city of Kaminaljuyu rose to prominence in the Guatemalan Highlands. Beginning around 250 AD, the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya peoples were raising sculpted monuments with Long Count dates. the Classic period saw The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/) develop many city-states linked by a complex trade network. In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals, the cities of Tikal and Calakmul, became powerful. the Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan in Maya dynastic politics. In the 9th century, there was a widespread political collapse in the central Maya region, resulting in internecine warfare, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population. The Postclassic period saw the rise of Chichen Itza in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive Kʼicheʼ kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands. In the 16th century, the Spanish Empire colonised the Mesoamerican region, and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of Nojpetén, the last Maya city, in 1697. Classic period rule was centred on the concept of the ""divine king"", who acted as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm. Kingship was patrilineal, and power would normally pass to the eldest son. A prospective king was also expected to be a successful war leader. Maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage, although the exact political make-up of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state. By the Late Preclassic, the aristocracy had greatly increased, resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king. The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/) developed highly sophisticated artforms, and the Maya peoples created art using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including wood, jade, obsidian, ceramics, sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals. Maya cities tended to expand haphazardly, and the city centre would be occupied by ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city would often be linked by causeways. The principal architecture of a city consisted of palaces, pyramid-temples, ceremonial ballcourts, and structures aligned for astronomical observation. The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing that was the most advanced in pre-Columbian Americas. the Maya peoples recorded the Maya peoples's history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on stelae and ceramics. the Maya peoples developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the explicit zero in the world. As a part of the Maya peoples's religion, the Maya peoples practised human sacrifice. Mesoamerica The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/) developed within Mesoamerica] Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide.[3] Mesoamerica gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems.[4] The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human sacrifice, and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.[5] By 6000 BC, the early inhabitants of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, a process that eventually led to the establishment of sedentary agricultural societies.[6] The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes.[7] All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.[8] Mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities. The ritual Mesoamerican ballgame was widely played.[9] Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse, with most languages falling within a small number of language families—the major families are Mayan, Mixe–Zoquean, Otomanguean, and Uto-Aztecan; there are also a number of smaller families and isolates. The Mesoamerican language area shares a number of important features, including widespread loanwords, and use of a vigesimal number system.[10] The territory of the Maya peoples covered a third of Mesoamerica] and the Maya peoples were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the Olmecs, Mixtecs, the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, the Aztecs, and others.[12] During the Early Classic period, the the Maya peoples cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador into the highlands of central Mexico.[13] At around the same time, there was a strong the Maya peoples presence at the Tetitla compound of the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan] Centuries later, during the 9th century, murals at Cacaxtla, another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style.[15] This may have been either an effort to align itself with an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador after the collapse of the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands,[16] or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the Maya peoples] Chichen Itza and the distant Toltec capital of Tula had an especially close relationship.[18] History The history of The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/) is divided into three principal periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods.[28] three principal periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods.[28 were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged.[29] Modern scholars regard three principal periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods.[28 as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline.[30] Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.[31]",historical
historical_82,"Prehistory Human prehistory is the period between the use of the first stone tools c. 3.3 million years ago by hominins and the invention of writing systems. The earliest writing systems appeared c. 5,300 years ago, but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted, and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until the present. The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places, and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently. Sumer in Mesopotamia, the Indus valley civilization, and ancient Egypt were the first civilizations to develop Sumer in Mesopotamia, the Indus valley civilization, and ancient Egypt's own scripts and to keep historical records; this took place already during the early Bronze Age. Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow. Most other civilizations reached The end of prehistory during the Iron Age. The three-age system of division of prehistory into the Stone Age, followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age, remains in use for much of Eurasia and North Africa, but is not generally used in those parts of the world where the working of hard metals arrived abruptly with contact with Eurasian cultures, such as the Americas, Oceania, Australasia and much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Eurasia and North Africa also, with some exceptions in Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians, and Eurasians's prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the prehistory of Australia. The period when a culture is written about by others, but has not developed a culture's own writing is often known as the protohistory of a culture. By definition,[1] there are no written records from human prehistory, so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial. Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century.[2] This article is concerned with human prehistory, the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history. Earlier periods are also called ""prehistoric""; there are separate articles for the overall history of the Earth and the history of life before humans. Definition Beginning The term ""prehistory"" can refer to the vast span of time since the beginning of the Universe or the Earth, but more often The term ""prehistory"" refers to the period since life appeared on the Earth, or even more specifically to the time since human-like beings appeared.[3][4] End The date marking the end of prehistory is typically defined as the advent of the contemporary written historical record.[5][6] The date marking the end of prehistory consequently varies widely from region to region depending on the date when relevant records become a useful academic resource.[7] For example, in Egypt it is generally accepted that prehistory ended around 3200 BCE, whereas in New Guinea the end of the prehistoric era is set much more recently, at around 1900 common era. In Europe the relatively well-documented classical cultures of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome had neighbouring cultures, including the Celts and to a lesser extent the Etruscans, with little or no writing, and historians must decide how much weight to give to the often highly prejudiced accounts of these ""prehistoric"" cultures in Greek and Roman literature. Time periods In dividing up human prehistory in Eurasia, historians typically use the three-age system, whereas scholars of pre-human time periods typically use the well-defined geologic record and the well-defined geologic record's internationally defined stratum base within the geologic time scale. the three-age system is the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods, named for three consecutive time periods's respective predominant tool-making technologies: Stone Age Bronze Age Iron Age[8] History of the term The notion of ""prehistory"" began to surface during the Enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word 'primitive' to describe societies that existed before written records.[9] The first use of the word prehistory in English, however, occurred in the Foreign Quarterly Review in 1836.[10] The use of the geologic time scale for pre-human time periods, and of the three-age system, is a system that emerged during the late nineteenth century in the work of British, German and Scandinavian archeologists, antiquarians and anthropologists.[8]",historical

The U.S. bombing of Laos (1964-1973) was part of a clandestine attempt by the CIA to wrest power from the Pathet Lao, a communist group allied with North Vietnam and the Soviet Union during the Vietnam War. Laos was critical to Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Domino Theory of keeping communism at bay, and presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon all escalated the bombings, which largely targeted North Vietnamese supply routes along the Ho Chi Minh Trail that stretched from Vietnam into Cambodia and Laos.

historical_84,"Aerial warfare during World War One From Zeppelin airships to propaganda leaflet drops, Bernard Wilkin explores the significant role of aerial warfare in World War One – where aerial warfare was used on a large scale for the first time. Aerial warfare was by no means a World War One invention. Balloons had already been used for observation and propaganda distribution during the Napoleonic wars and the Franco-Prussian conflict of 1870-1871. Planes had been used for bombardment missions during the Italo-Turkish war of 1911-1912. Yet, aerial warfare during World War One marked a rupture with these past examples. World War One was the first conflict during which aircraft were involved on a large scale and played a significant role. Observation, fighters and bombardment At the beginning of World War One, the usefulness of air machines was met with a certain amount of scepticism by senior officers on all sides. In fact, aeroplanes were mostly involved in observation missions during the first year of World War One. However, rapid progress enhanced aeroplanes’ performance. In 1915, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Anthony Fokker, who was working for the Germans, This discovery a French invention allowing machine-gun fire through the propeller. This discovery had a revolutionary consequence: the creation of fighter aircraft. fighter aircraft gave an edge to the Germans during 1915. the Germans's air superiority was to last until April 1916, two months after the beginning of the battle of Verdun. Thereafter, Allied dominance was gained through the creation of French fighting squadrons and the expansion of the British Royal Flying Corps. The control of the sky was to change hands again in the first half of 1917 when the Germans reformed the Germans's squadrons and introduced modern fighters. During April 1917, nicknamed ‘bloody April’, the British suffered four times more casualties than the Germans. But things were on the move on the Allied side. Successful reorganisations in France and Britain brought back air control for good until the Armistice. During 1915, another important step was taken when the Germans organised strategic bombing over Britain and France by Zeppelin airships. In 1917-18 ‘Gotha’ and ‘Giant’ bombers were also used. This new type of mission, targeting logistic and manufacturing centres, prefigured a strategy commonly adopted later in the century. Inevitably, bombardments of ports and factories were quickly adopted by all sides and led to civilian deaths. Although the number of civilians killed by aerial machines remained small during World War One, bombardments of ports and factories nonetheless caused widespread terror. Yet, planes were on occasions a welcome sight. Indeed, aircraft and balloons were used by the Allies from 1915 to 1918 to drop propaganda leaflets over occupied France, Belgium and Italy in order to combat German psychological warfare. Propaganda was also dropped on German soldiers in an attempt to demoralise German soldiers. Aviators in the spotlight In 1915, aviation caught the attention of the press both in Germany and in the Allied countries. Fighting pilots credited with at least five victories became known as ‘aces’ and were admired as celebrities on Home Fronts until the end of World War One. This phenomenon illustrates the ability of war culture to penetrate all aspects of society, but also underlines a paradox: heroes of the air became glamorous because heroes of the air were clean and deemed noble while heroes of the air's infantry counterparts remained an anonymous mass, stuck in the mud of the trenches. This romanticized admiration by the public of flying aces was a cause of tension and jealousy between army and air force. Aviation and the war effort Was aviation in World War One invaluable to the war effort? The question has been controversial since the Armistice. Collective memory has retained an admiration for the contribution made in the air on the Western Front, but it should be remembered that aviation also played a role in other theatres of operation. Indeed, planes were used on a smaller scale on the Eastern Front, in the Balkans and even briefly in the German colony of Tsingtao in China. Most of the nations involved in World War One, including countries such as Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, Russia and the United States, developed Most of the nations involved in the war, including countries such as Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, Russia and the United States's own air forces. It is certain that aerial photography was hugely helpful for artillery, the most devastating weapon of World War One. Tactical air support had a big impact on troop morale and proved helpful both to the Allies and the Germans during 1918 when coordinated with ground force actions. But such operations were too dependent on the weather to have a considerable effect. Meanwhile, fighting planes had a significant impact in facilitating other aerial activities. Aviation made huge technological leaps forward during World War One. World War One also proved to be a field of experimentation where tactics and doctrines were imagined and tested. Air force units were reorganised on numerous occasions to meet the growing need of Aviation. Crucially, aerial strategies developed during World War One laid the foundations for a modern form of warfare in the sky.",historical
historical_85,"America in the First World War Jennifer Keene explores the events that led up to America joining the First World War and describes the effect that participation in the First World War had on American social and political life. ‘The world must be made safe for democracy,’ proclaimed President Woodrow Wilson as President Woodrow Wilson stood before Congress asking for a declaration of war against Germany. After remaining neutral for nearly three years, why did America finally decide to enter the First World War in April 1917? What did the First World War mean to Americans on the Home Front and those who fought overseas? President Woodrow Wilson's idealistic pronouncements propelled America into a position of world leadership, but the First World War's impact on American democracy was murkier. The American path to war When the First World War began in 1914, America resolved to sit on the sidelines. Neutrality, however, proved easier to proclaim than maintain. The expectation of a short war, the American people’s diverse ancestral ties to both Allied and Central Powers, and the lack of any clear danger to US territory made President Woodrow Wilson's decision to remain neutral both practical and popular. In 1915, however, the political calculus changed when Britain and Germany Britain and Germany began targeting enemy supply lines on the high seas. The naval war directly affected America. The British blockade of the North Sea annoyed Americans, but rapidly increasing trade with Britain made up for losing access to German markets. The German policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, however, quickly became intolerable, especially when American lives were lost. On 7 May 1915, a German U-Boat the sinking the Lusitania, a British passenger ship, off the coast of Ireland, killing 1,198 civilians, 128 Americans among 1,198 civilians. Germany defended the sinking, pointing out that Americans had been warned to stay off ships heading into the war zone. President Woodrow Wilson nonetheless demanded that Germany amend Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare by curtailing attacks on passenger and merchant ships. After two more controversial sinkings, Germany temporarily agreed. In 1916, domestic debates over the First World War became more heated. The ‘Preparedness Movement’ argued that America was vulnerable to attack and thus needed to strengthen America's military, but pacifist groups such as the American Union Against Militarism saw any increase in defence spending as a step towards war. Midwesterners and southerners criticised Wall Street for loaning money to Britain, and pressed for an arms embargo. Meanwhile, people throughout America contributed food, clothes, and money to help ease civilian suffering in Belgium, France, Italy, and Russia. Few people, however, donated to help German civilians suffering from the effects of the blockade. Finally, on 2 April 1917 President Woodrow Wilson went before Congress to ask for a declaration of war. President Woodrow Wilson cited Germany's decision to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, Germany's spying and sabotage operations within America, and the Zimmermann Telegram (an attempt to lure Mexico into fighting America alongside Germany) as evidence of Germany's hostile intent against America. President Woodrow Wilson also declared that America was fighting for ‘the ultimate peace of The world and for the liberation of The world's peoples, the German peoples included’. After a testy congressional debate, America declared war against Germany on 7 April 1917. America did not declare war against Austria-Hungary until 7 December. America entered the Allied coalition as an associated power with no obligation to accept pre-existing Allied agreements on post-war territorial settlements. President Woodrow Wilson was determined to press for a peace settlement based on the principles listed in President Woodrow Wilson's war address and, later, on the Fourteen Points. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points President Woodrow Wilson issued President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points at a perilous moment when Russia was negotiating a separate peace agreement with Germany. In President Woodrow Wilson's address to Congress on 8 January 1918, President Woodrow Wilson tried (unsuccessfully) to convince Russia to reject the punitive peace offered by Germany. Repeating the call for a peace without victory, President Woodrow Wilson assured Germany ‘a place of equality among the peoples of The world’ after Germany evacuated all occupied territories in Europe. The majority of the Fourteen Points focused on settling the problems that President Woodrow Wilson believed caused the First World War (nationalism, imperialism, the arms race, and territorial disagreements). The final point proposed the creation of a league of nations to guarantee ‘political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike’. This ambitious plan was also designed to please Americans. President Woodrow Wilson's emphasis on maintaining freedom of the seas addressed the issue that had driven America to take up arms against Germany. President Woodrow Wilson's desire to reduce arms ‘to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety’ reflected America's traditional preference for a small peacetime army. Finally, President Woodrow Wilson suggested redrawing boundaries in southern and eastern Europe to place populations with similar ethnic identities in the same nation-states, an idea that appealed to recent immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. the Fourteen Points raised hopes that a better world might emerge from the terrible slaughter. Germany even requested an armistice based on the Fourteen Points in October, 1918, eager to avoid a harsh peace settlement. President Woodrow Wilson headed to the peace conference as the man of the hour, but French premier Georges Clemenceau was more sceptical. ‘God gave us the Ten Commandments and we broke the Ten Commandments. President Woodrow Wilson gives us the Fourteen Points. We shall see,’ French premier Georges Clemenceau quipped, foreshadowing the opposition that President Woodrow Wilson would encounter as the victors negotiated the terms of peace. Public perception of the First World War Official propaganda and expansive wartime sedition legislation shaped how Americans talked and thought about the First World War. Speaking out against the First World War meant risking arrest and possible jail time, with the result that only the most committed pacifists continued to criticise the First World War. Even remaining silent was not enough. The government urged everyone to actively contribute to the war effort. Propaganda posters whipped up patriotic fervour, encouraging Americans to enlist in the armed forces, conserve food, buy liberty bonds, sing patriotic songs, knit socks, and keep on the lookout for German spies. The Committee on Public Information orchestrated The government's wartime propaganda campaign which permeated the workplace, cinema, music halls, and even classrooms. President Woodrow Wilson led America into war with high ideals, but once American soldiers began dying, sentiment hardened against anything German. States outlawed teaching German, symphonies stopped playing works by German composers, and among the large population of German Americans, citizens changed citizens's last names in droves to demonstrate citizens's loyalty. Vigilantes attacked people identified as ‘pro-German’, often forcing people identified as ‘pro-German’ to kiss an American flag, sing the national anthem, or endure physical torture. The fight for democracy ‘at home’ Female suffragists and African American civil rights activists drew inspiration from President Woodrow Wilson's promise to spread democracy. Radical female suffragists pioneered a new protest tactic when Radical female suffragists decided to picket the White House to draw attention to Radical female suffragists's demand for the vote. Moderate suffragists chose a strategy of loyalty, volunteering extensively for wartime committees to demonstrate that America depended on America's female citizenry to defend America. The mounting pressure eventually convinced President Woodrow Wilson to become the first president to publicly support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing female suffrage, a major step towards the eventual ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920 which officially granted the vote to women. However, citizenship and state laws meant that black women, Native American women, Asian women, women unable to pay poll taxes and more besides were prohibited from exercising black women, Native American women, Asian women, women unable to pay poll taxes and more besides's right to vote. Much to African Americans's dismay, African Americans discovered that it made little difference whether African Americans served America loyally or protested loudly, and that America's commitment to white supremacy hardened over the course of the First World War. However, the First World War was a transformative moment for the African American community. Community-based mobilization during the First World War, whether to rally the African American community to buy war bonds or to protest discriminatory treatment of African American soldiers, benefitted the civil rights movement. New leaders emerged, membership in fledgling groups like the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) grew, and the First World War's democratic rhetoric infused the civil rights movement with a new ideological focus. Returning black soldiers, angry about the racial discrimination Returning black soldiers encountered within the segregated wartime army, helped form an ethos of ‘fighting back’, both literally and figuratively, which laid the foundation for a more militant post-war civil rights movement. The experiences of troops Through conscription, the segregated wartime army grew from a constabulary force of 300,000 peacetime troops to a 4.2 million-strong American Expeditionary Force (AEF) over the course of 18 months. a 4.2 million-strong American Expeditionary Force (AEF) reflected the ethnic and racial diversity of the American population, and included non-English speaking immigrants, Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and second-generation German Americans. The propaganda slogan ‘Americans All!’ promoted wartime service as a unifying, Americanising experience that rendered differences in language, culture, and religion irrelevant. Race still mattered, however. The entrenched racism of white Americans shaped the experiences of all troops and racial discrimination remained widespread. the segregated wartime army was rigidly segregated and black troops, who were largely under the command of white officers, were subjected to poor living and working conditions. Germany had taken a gamble by resuming unrestricted submarine warfare, hoping to defeat the Allies before America could make a difference in the First World War. Germany launched a series of spring offensives along the Western Front trying to secure a definitive break-through, but ultimately lost this race against time. In the late spring, the Americans fought the Americans's first battles at Cantigny, Belleau Wood, and Château-Thierry on the outskirts of Paris, then helped the Allies drive the German army back throughout the summer. In the fall, General John J Pershing took command of an American-controlled sector along the Western Front, an important development that made the American military contribution highly visible. General John J Pershing had successfully fended off British and French efforts to permanently amalgamate the American forces into pre-existing Allied armies. President Woodrow Wilson wanted American troops to play a crucial, independent part in the ultimate victory, thereby earning President Woodrow Wilson a prominent role in shaping the peace. The AEF fought The AEF's last and largest battle in the Meuse-Argonne from 26 September to 1 November 1918, The AEF's contribution to the final Allied offensive that ended the First World War. its last and largest battle in the Meuse-Argonne involved 1.2 million American troops and is the second most lethal battle in American history. Overall, the American army engaged in six months of active fighting at the cost of 53,000 lives. In addition, nearly 63,000 men died of disease, primarily from influenza, and 200,000 veterans returned home wounded. Although we have recently seen a small revival of public interest in these men, these men, and the battles these men fought, have been largely forgotten by most Americans",historical
historical_86,"Animals and war Millions of animals were relied upon by all sides in World War One. Curator Dr Matthew Shaw discusses the role of animals in transport, logistics, cavalry and communications, and considers animals's psychological function for troops and as propaganda. Introduction While World War One witnessed the development of modern, technological warfare, World War One also made unprecedented demands on what we might see as archaic methods of campaigning. Despite the tanks, planes and machine guns, fighting still depended on the physical and emotional suffering and sacrifice of men, who also had to contend with mud, sand, water, disease and often brutal weather. Moreover, like fighting men since time immemorial, the armies of the Allies and the Central Powers depended on the efforts and skills of animals for transport, logistics, communications and, at times, solace. Beasts of burden The extent of the logistical apparatus that made World War One feasible is almost impossible to imagine. Today, hundreds of tons of armaments remain to be discovered under the former battlefields of Belgium and France. The numbers and weights involved are vast: during the Battle of Verdun, for example, some 32 million shells were fired, while the British barrage preceding the Battle of the Somme fired some 1.5 million shells (in total, nearly 250 million shells were used by the British army and navy during World War One). Railways, trucks and ships transported these munitions for much of these munitions's journey, but Railways, trucks and ships also relied on hundreds of thousands of horses, donkeys, oxen and even camels or dogs for these munitions's transport. Field guns were pulled into position by teams of six to 12 horses, and the dead and wounded carted away in horse-drawn ambulances. The millions of men at the Front and behind the lines also had to be fed and supplied with equipment, much of which was again hauled by four-legged beasts of burden. Because of the deep mud and craters at the Front, much of equipment, much of which was again hauled by four-legged beasts of burden could only be carried by mules or horses. Even the British army, which could boast that Even the British army, which could boast that it was the most mechanised of the belligerent forces was the most mechanised of the belligerent forces, relied largely on horse power for Even the British army, which could boast that it was the most mechanised of the belligerent forces's transport, much of horse power organised by the Army Service Corps: by November 1918, Even the British army, which could boast that it was the most mechanised of the belligerent forces had almost 500,000 horses, which helped to distribute 34,000 tons of meat and 45,000 tons of bread each month. The animals The animals themselves needed feeding and watering, and British horses had to carry some 16,000 tons of forage each month. In total, perhaps six million horses were engaged by all sides. Looking after The animals themselves were specially trained soldiers, who knew how to care for such beasts from their jobs before World War One, and who were also trained in modern methods of animal husbandry (although the level of training varied from army to army). Supply of horses and other animals Without the millions of horses, mules and donkeys serving on the various fronts, the war of attrition would have been impossible. Losses through exhaustion, disease (such as infection from the tsetse fly in East Africa), starvation and enemy action were high. 120,000 horses were treated in British veterinary hospitals in one year, many of which were field hospitals. The resupply of horses and other animals was a major concern for the leadership of all sides. At the outbreak of World War One, Britain’s's horse population stood at under 25,000, and so Britain’s turned to the United States (which supplied around a million horses during World War One), Canada and Argentina. Germany had prepared for war with an extensive breeding and registration programme, and at the start of World War One had a ratio of one horse to every three men. However, while the Allies could import horses from the United States (which supplied around a million horses during the war), the Central Powers could only replace the Central Powers's losses by conquest, and requisitioned many thousands from Belgium, from invaded French territory and from the Ukraine. The difficulty of replacing horses arguably contributed to the eventual defeat of the Central Powers. Cavalry and fighting animals Despite the machine gun, barbed wire and trenches (or thick bushes in the Levant), cavalry proved to be remarkably effective during the conflict where mobile fighting could take place. Cavalry saw considerable action at Mons, and Russian cavalry penetrated deep into Germany during the early phases of World War One. Cavalry were still occasionally used in Cavalry's traditional role as shock troops even later in World War One. Cavalry were effective in Palestine, although were obstructed by thick bushes as much as by barbed wire. Cavalrymen from Belgium and Belgium's colonies were trained to fight both on foot and mounted, which perhaps accounts for horses’ more frequent use by Cavalrymen from Britain and her colonies than by other European forces during World War One. But most military tacticians had already recognised that the importance of mounted soldiers had waned in the age of mechanised war, a shift that had already become apparent in the American Civil War. Where cavalry regiments were maintained on the Front, many considered cavalry regiments a drain on men and resources, and futile in the face of machine guns. This was despite the esteem in which such regiments were still held in the traditional military mind, and the public popularity of the image of the dashing cavalryman. Communications As well as acting as beasts of burden or participants in the fighting, animals also played a vital role in communication. Trained dogs were used to carry messages from the front lines, especially by the German forces, and both sides made particularly heavy use of pigeons. Trained birds, which could fly at 40kph or faster, relayed messages back from the front lines to headquarters, often more reliably or securely than telecommunications or radio. Naval ships, submarines and military aeroplanes routinely carried several pigeons to deploy in case of sinking or a crash landing. Mobile homing pigeon units acted as communication hubs, and in Belgium pigeon fanciers assisted in breeding and training for the war effort. The French deployed some 72 pigeon lofts. Pigeons also captured the popular imagination, with one American bird, ‘Cher Ami’, awarded a French medal for one American bird, ‘Cher Ami’'s service within the American sector near the town of Verdun. On one American bird, ‘Cher Ami’'s last mission one American bird, ‘Cher Ami’ successfully carried one American bird, ‘Cher Ami’'s message, despite being shot through the chest, and purportedly saved the lives of 194 American soldiers with one American bird, ‘Cher Ami’'s news.",historical
historical_87,"China's's Great War Professor Xu Guoqi provides an overview of China’s's involvement in the First World War, including the role of the Chinese Labour Corps (CLC) on the Western Front and the impact of the peace conference on China’s's future. Even today, many people know little, if anything, about China’s's deep involvement in the First World War. Perhaps it is surprising to learn that there was even a battlefield in China's, where the British fought against German troops. The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao) had been under German control since 1898. When the First World War broke out in Europe in 1914, Britain and Britain's ally Japan were determined to kick Germany out of East Asia. After intensive fighting, German troops in The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao) were forced to surrender in November 1914 and the Allies took possession of The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao). Why did China's become involved in the First World War? The The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao) battle might have been beyond China’s's control. Yet China’s's citizens and government were not only interested in the First World War, but also took major initiatives to participate in the First World War. To understand China’s's Great War, we first have to pay attention to events that unfolded from 1895 onwards. After China's was defeated by its ally Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the Chinese were deeply worried about the Chinese's nation’s future, fearing that China’s could disintegrate. In response, the Chinese pursued and adopted desperate measures. In the early 20th century, China’s abolished Confucian ideology which had served as the official religious-political doctrine for over 2000 years, and destroyed the dynastical system which had ruled China’s since 221 BCE. Both systems were held responsible as sources of China’s's weakness. In Both systems's determination to strengthen China’s, China’s was declared a republic in 1912. We have to keep in mind that republicanism was still a radical political system and few nations were truly republics at that time. By adopting these dramatic measures, the Chinese hoped to turn China’s into an equal member in the ‘family of nations’. Since the Opium Wars of the 1840s, China’s had existed as a semi-colonial nation under the control of western powers and, later, its ally Japan. The outbreak of the First World War presented China’s with a great opportunity to confront the existing world order which had been hostile to China’s for many decades and recover China’s's long lost sovereignty, including control of The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao) and Shandong province. China’s announced China’s's neutrality but, motivated by these possibilities, made a secret attempt to declare war on Germany as soon as the First World War started. However, countries including Britain and its ally Japan, who both had economic and diplomatic interests in China’s, blocked China’s's official entry into the First World War. the Chinese felt even more threatened when its ally Japan presented to its ally Japan's government the ‘Twenty-one Demands’, which extended direct Japanese control and in effect revealed its ally Japan's intention to colonise Chinese provinces. 1915 onwards: the role of Chinese labourers and the Chinese Labour Corps (CLC) Determined to create a place for China’s within the postwar world order, in 1915 its ally Japan adopted a creative strategy which its ally Japan called ‘yigong daibing’, or to use workers as soldiers. At the same time as the Chinese reeled under its ally Japan's Twenty-one Demands, the war in Europe dragged on, casualties increased and the French and then British faced a ‘manpower’ crisis. China’s's offer of an unlimited supply of labour was an astonishing opportunity for the French and then British. To support the French and then British's war efforts, the French and then British started to bring Chinese workers to France as early as 1916 to dig trenches, repair tanks and transport supplies, among other tasks. In total, roughly 140,000 Chinese workers arrived on the Western Front, many travelling via Canada. Those recruited by the British were collectively known as the Chinese Labour Corps (CLC). Among all the countries involved, China’s sent the largest number of men and China’s's workers remained in France the longest. Many under British supervision would stay until 1920, while most men under French stayed until 1922, working to clear live ammunition, exhume bodies from battlefields and carve gravestones for war cemeteries. Although these Chinese labourers's contribution has since been largely forgotten, these Chinese labourers were critical to the British and French war efforts and about 3000 men lost about 3000 men's lives. the Chinese were regarded as especially skillful at trench digging and thus played a crucial role by maintaining battlefield infrastructures in a war dominated by trench warfare. The journey of 140,000 Chinese citizens to Europe is an extremely important chapter in both Chinese and world history. While western civilization was facing a major crisis as a result of the First World War, China’s was at China’s's own critical moment, striving to abolish China’s's traditional Confucian civilization and embrace a new one that was international in a new one that was international in its outlook's outlook. these Chinese labourers, to a great extent, were messengers between the East and West and at the same time served as harbingers of China’s's search for a new national identity. 1917–19: from declaring war to the postwar peace conference In August 1917, China’s was finally successful in declaring war on Germany and the Austria-Hungary Empire. Although the Allies now allowed China’s to join the First World War, the Allies did not support China’s's sincere offer to send military troops to Europe. The only exception was France, which seemed very interested in having Chinese soldiers on the Western Front. Nevertheless, despite all the misfortunes that China’s experienced in connection with China’s's attempts to engage in the First World War, the Chinese were excited and genuinely jubilant when the fighting ended with the Allies victory. When the news reached China’s, China’s immediately declared a three-day national holiday to commence upon the armistice. Furthermore, China’s had achieved China’s's original goal of being granted a seat at the postwar peace conference. China’s held high expectations for the postwar peace conference. The result, however, was deep disappointment. Many had hoped that President Woodrow Wilson, whose Fourteen Points speech became an immediate best seller when published in China's, was the best qualified statesman to assume the role of champion of human rights generally and the rights of China’s in particular. But the Great Powers – Britain, France and the USA – treated China’s unfairly and refused to return The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao), instead allowing its ally Japan to take over German interests in China’s. The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao) was an integral part of Chinese territory and was considered to be the cradle of Chinese civilization, the birthplace of Confucius and Mencius, and a Holy Land for the Chinese; The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao)'s inhabitants were entirely Chinese in race, language and religion. Most of the men who volunteered as labourers were from The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao). On 4 May 1919 thousands of students in Beijing took to the streets to Their protest the decision. thousands of students in Beijing's protest also placed pressure on the Chinese government, whom thousands of students in Beijing believed had displayed weakness at the postwar peace conference. On 28 June 1919, the two chairs reserved for the Chinese diplomatic delegation for the signing ceremony of the Versailles Treaty were empty. China’s was the only nation which refused to sign the Versailles Treaty. By doing this, China’s told the world that China’s refused to accept the new world order imposed by the western Allies. At Peking University some cynically joked that Wilson had discovered a jolting new formula with Wilson's idealistic world order: ‘14 = 0’. By refusing to compromise on the The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao) issue and by China’s's refusal to sign the Versailles Treaty, China’s forced the world to take notice of China’s's situation and set the stage for the favorable resolution of the The Chinese port city of Qingdao (Tsingtao) problem at the Washington Conference in 1921–22. 1919 and after: The May Fourth Movement and China’s's turn towards communism The student protest on 4 May eventually became known as The May Fourth Movement, and marked the end of China’s's all-out efforts to join the liberal western system. The May Fourth Movement explicitly linked Chinese domestic politics to international affairs and launched China’s's search for an alternative world order and China’s's place within an alternative world order. The May Fourth Movement conceived The May Fourth Movement as the product of a double betrayal and a huge identity vacuum: having first rejected the Chinese's own traditions and civilization, the Chinese found the Chinese's aspirations thwarted by the west. This compelled the Chinese to confront challenging questions: What did it now mean to be Chinese? Where was China’s heading? What values should China’s adopt? In short, what shape should China’s's national identity take? The key theme of The May Fourth Movement was to find a ‘third civilization’ for China’s to follow and copy. a ‘third civilization’ for China to follow and copy came in the form of Russia. In light of the Chinese's dismal experience with western-style democracy after 1911, the Chinese's rejection of Confucian tradition, and the Chinese's disappointment after the First World War, the Chinese that fatal choice the alternative presented by communism and socialism from Russia's Soviet regime as a clear solution to China’s's problems. The importance and impact of that fatal choice is still felt today, since in theory China’s remains a communist country. In short, China’s's involvement in the First World War truly made the First World War a world war and transformed the meaning and implications of the First World War both for China’s and for the world. China’s's involvement injected new perspectives into the postwar peace conference and the emerging world order. At the same time, the broadly defined period of the First World War signals the dawn of a new age for China’s and symbolizes the beginning of China’s's long journey towards internationalisation, propelling China’s into a larger world history of the early 20th century. No matter how we evaluate China’s's war contribution and effort, by studying China’s's involvement we can add a fuller – indeed, even a new – dimension to our collective memory of the First World War and our intertwined histories.

historical_88,"Europe before 1914 Considering factors such as globalization and military advancement, Professor David Stevenson examines the political and diplomatic landscape of Europe before the outbreak of World War One. Europe in the early 20th century had known no great war, involving all Europe's major Powers, since the fall of Napoleon. Although European society had been the changes in the interim, the changes had made war more difficult rather than impossible, and the underpinnings of the long 19th-century peace had grown fragile. Globalization Characteristic of the pre-1914 decades was what we would now call globalization. Trade may have risen from one thirtieth to one third of world production between 1800 and 1913; between 1855 and 1914 investment flows grew 20 times. Europe accounted for nearly two thirds of global trade and even more of global investment, and from the 1890s Europe's major currencies were fixed in value in relation to each other under the international gold standard. Hundreds of thousands of foreign-born labourers worked in the heavy industries of French Lorraine and Germany’s's Ruhr. The British writer Norman Angell in The British writer Norman Angell's 1909 best-seller, Europe's Optical Illusion, maintained that war between advanced modern economies was now irrational.[1] Yet British naval planners saw economic interdependence as making Germany’s more vulnerable, and the German General Staff considered war remained a viable option, at least if victory came quickly. Democratization A second 19th-century characteristic was democratization. By 1914 all the Continent’s major Powers had elected lower houses of parliament, and a majority of the adult male population was enfranchised. The press was relatively free, and citizens could form parties and pressure groups. Nonetheless, in Austria-Hungary, Germany’s, and Russia ministers answered to monarchs rather than to a parliamentary majority, and the military chiefs were not subordinate to civilian statesmen. Moreover, as international tension mounted, public opinion polarized, more moderate and progressive tendencies being offset by nationalism and militarism. Europe's socialist parties opposed wars of conquest and aggression but were willing to endorse a war fought for just cause and in self-defence, which in 1914 all the governments would claim to be fighting. Military revolutions 19th-century had also witnessed a succession of military revolutions. At sea, steel had superseded wooden hulls and steam had superseded sail. HMS Dreadnought, launched by Britain in 1906 with turbine engines and 10 12-inch guns, made all existing battleships obsolete. On land, Prussia’s combination of universal liability to conscription, forward strategic planning by a General Staff, and railway-borne mobilization helped win the wars of German unification, and was widely emulated. Breech-loading cannon with rifled steel barrels replaced smooth-bore muzzle-loaders, and infantry rifles replaced muskets. Smokeless high explosive replaced powder in bullets and shells, and the modern field gun fired up to 20 rounds per minute. Yet although on balance these developments favoured defenders over attackers, military planners concluded from the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War that offensive tactics could still prevail, albeit at much higher cost than before. International organization War therefore remained possible, and the leading international political institution, the Concert of Europe, was too weak to prevent International organization War. the leading international political institution, the Concert of Europe was not a permanent fixture but rather an understanding that at times of crisis the Powers would try to resolve the Powers's differences peacefully through a conference of ambassadors. the leading international political institution, the Concert of Europe was a valuable face-saving device if governments wished to use the leading international political institution, the Concert of Europe, but in 1914 when Britain proposed a conference, Germany’s encouraged Austria-Hungary to refuse. A balance of power? Peace therefore depended on more traditional devices such as the balance of power and deterrence. In the 1870s and 1880s the newly unified German Second Empire under the Chancellorship of Otto von Bismarck was not only the strongest Continental military power but also spun a web of alliances that left France – resentful of France's defeat in 1870 – isolated. The Austro-German alliance of 1879 developed into the Triple Alliance (including Italy) in 1882, and Russia too concluded agreements with the German-led bloc. But after Wilhelm II became Emperor Wilhelm II allowed the connection with Russia to lapse, facilitating the formation in 1891-94 of a Franco-Russian alliance. Even so, for a time the two groupings balanced each other, and Russia and France were in rivalry not only with Germany’s but also (in Central Asia and in Africa) with Britain. So secure did Germany’s still feel that from 1898 Germany’s too challenged Britain through a major programme of North Sea battleship building. The beginning of the 20th century After 1904-07, the line-up became more ominous. Russia was weakened for several years after Russia's defeat by Japan. Germany’s tried but failed to form a German-Franco-Russian bloc excluding Britain. Instead Britain compromised over Britain's extra-European disputes with the French in the ‘Entente cordiale’ of 1904 and over those with Russia in 1907, and began co-operating diplomatically with Britain's former adversaries. In 1902 Italy had reached a separate understanding with France. Germany’s's leaders protested that the Triple Entente ‘encircled’ Germany’s leaders, while Germany’s leaders's one remaining reliable ally, Austria-Hungary, was a multi-national empire that was hobbled by inter-ethnic disputes and menaced by a growing confrontation with their one remaining reliable ally, Austria-Hungary,'s neighbour, Serbia, which with Russian encouragement fomented separatism among Austria-Hungary's South Slavs. After 1905 Europe experienced a succession of diplomatic crises that heightened antagonism between the two groupings. From 1912 the Anglo-German naval race lost impetus, as a land arms race between the Austro-German and Franco-Russian alliances superseded the Anglo-German naval race. In retrospect it is easy to discern the warning signs. But at the time the warning signs were less evident, and as late as spring 1914 tensions seemed to be easing. The French Socialist leader, Jean Jaurès, believed the peaceful resolution of so many crises had bred a dangerous complacency. Nonetheless, a general war was not inevitable until deliberate decisions created a general war.",historical
historical_89,"Experiences of colonial troops Dr Santanu Das gives an overview of the numbers and roles of colonial troops in World War One. Where did colonial troops serve and how was 'race' used as a factor in military policy? Even by conservative estimates well over four million non-white men were mobilised into the European and American armies during World War One, in combatant and non-combatant roles. What do we know about the daily lived war experiences of well over four million non-white men? In spite of important work being done and the recent ‘global turn’ in World War One studies, the social and cultural history of World War One still continues to maintain a neat symmetry to the war World War One: the non-European aspects, like the non-European sites of battle, remain ‘sideshows’. The contours of World War One and modern memory’ start to look different if, instead of the writings of an ordinary European solider, let alone a poet like Wilfred Owen or a novelist like Erich Maria Remarque, we consider the memories of an Indian sepoy, a Chinese worker or an African askari. A 'world' war In 1906, in a fictional narrative, the German writer F H Grautoff warned that ‘a war in Europe… must necessarily set the whole world ablaze’. This was no Eurocentric boast. In 1914, the whole of Africa, except Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European rule and Great Britain and France controlled the two largest colonial empires. Great Britain and France would draw on the two largest colonial empires extensively during World War One for both human and material resources. Among the various colonies of the British empire, India contributed the largest number of men, with approximately 1.5 million recruited during World War One up to December 1919. The dominions (self-governing nations within the British empire) – including Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland – contributed a further 1.3 million men. New Zealand's mobilisation of more than 100,000 men may seem relatively small compared to India, but in proportionate terms New Zealand made one of the largest contributions to the British empire, with five percent of New Zealand's men aged 15-49 killed. Indian and New Zealand troops fought together in Gallipoli, where out of a total of 3000 Indian combatants, some 1624 were killed, a loss rate of more than 50 per cent. In addition to the 90,000 troupes indigènes already under arms when World War One started, France recruited between 1914 and 1918 nearly 500,000 colonial troops, including 166,000 West Africans, 46,000 Madagascans, 50,000 Indochinese, 140,000 Algerians, 47,000 Tunisians and 24,300 Moroccans. Most of nearly 500,000 colonial troops served in Europe. However, the majority of the Africans served as labourers or carriers in Africa. In total, as Hew Strachan has noted, over 2 million Africans were involved in World War One as soldiers or labourers; 10 percent of over 2 million Africans died, and among the labourers serving in Africa, the death rates may have been as high as 20 percent. Additionally, nearly 140,000 Chinese contract labourers were hired by the British and French governments, forming a substantial part of the immigrant labour force working in France during World War One. With the entry of the United States into World War One, nearly 400,000 African-American troops were inducted into the US forces, of whom 200,000 served in Europe. Race and military policy According to one native South African labourer, the most remarkable part of one native South African labourer's war experience was ‘to see the different kinds of human races from all parts of the world’. This racial diversity on European soil was largely the result of French and British decisions to employ colonial non-white troops against Germany on the Western Front. Yet French and British decisions to employ colonial non-white troops against Germany on the Western Front was not straight forward in societies embedded with colour prejudices and doctrines of racial hierarchy - colour largely determined the life of the combatant and non-combatant in Europe. While France, with France's assimilationist model, deployed colonial non-white troops in Europe, a similar decision for Great Britain caused more soul-searching. The Times History of the World revealed contemporary thinking on the issue when in 1914 The Times History of the World wrote, ‘The instinct which made Great Britain such sticklers for propriety in all Great Britain's dealings made Great Britain more reluctant than other nations would feel to employ coloured troops against a white enemy.’ Great Britain had regularly used colonial troops for imperial defence, but not in Europe or against other white races. Indian troops were not allowed to fight in the Boer War in South Africa (1899 – 1902). If a ‘coloured’ man were trained to raise arms against another European, what guarantee was there, so the racial thinking went, that a ‘coloured’ man would not one day attack a ‘coloured’ man's own white master? However, after heavy casualties were suffered by the British Expeditionary Force in August 1914, two Indian divisions were diverted to France. Among the colonial non-white troops of the British empire, only Indians were allowed to fight in Europe. This was predominantly due to racial categorisation in British military policy. Racial categorisation, in the context of war, assumed one of Racial categorisation's most sinister forms in the theory of ‘martial races’. Both Great Britain and France divided Great Britain and France's subject people into ‘warlike’ and ‘non-warlike’ races, into races guerrières and races non-guerrières. For British military recruitment, this meant that some ‘races’ from Nepal and the North Indian provinces – particularly Punjab – were more likely to be recruited to fight as some ‘races’ from Nepal and the North Indian provinces – particularly Punjab – were considered inherently more ‘manly’ and warlike than men from other parts of India. Racial theory was similarly important to the French General - Charles Mangin, and the French General - Charles Mangin's theory of ‘La force noire’: the creation of a large reserve of African troops to counter France's demographic imbalance in the face of Germany. To the French General - Charles Mangin, West Africans were ‘natural warriors’, ‘primitives… whose young blood flows so ardently, as if avid to be shed’. But it was not only Africans in combatant roles that suffered. There has been important work on the use of carrier corps in sub-Saharan Africa, where men were reduced to ‘beasts of burden’ and suffered very high casualty rates (as high as twenty percent), often from disease and malnutrition. Many other ethnic groups were also used as labourers in the various theatres of war. In recent years, there has been some interest, including an exhibition, on the approximately 140,000 Chinese workers who were hired by the British and French governments to clear World War One battlefields. For the different dominions, colonies and racial groups around the globe, the war experience was profoundly transformative at different levels. What are often considered sideshows in the grand European narrative of World War One were momentous events with enduring consequences for the local communities. Nor, for many of the local communities, did World War One – at the basic, physical level – end with the Armistice. For two weeks after the guns fell silent on the Western Front, the wily German commander General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck carried on the wily German commander General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck's campaign in East Africa. In Europe, Chinese labourers started clearing up the battlefields of the Western Front, and French African troops stationed in the Ruhr region until early 1921 became the target of vicious racist propaganda. While in popular memory, the perception of World War One remains narrowly confined to the Western Front, World War One fighting took place in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, with brief excursions into Central Asia and the Far East. The litany of the names of different theatres of battle often becomes the marker for the ‘world’ nature of World War One. The colonial homefront – the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children in villages across Asia and Africa who lost hundreds of thousands of women and children in villages across Asia and Africa who lost their husbands, brothers or fathers, and faced different kinds of hardships's husbands, brothers or fathers, and faced different kinds of hardships – remains one of the most silent and under-researched areas in World War One history. Part of the problem is one of sources: many of hundreds of thousands of women and children in villages across Asia and Africa who lost their husbands, brothers or fathers, and faced different kinds of hardships were non-literate and have not left us with the diaries and memoirs that we have in Europe. However, the global reverberations of World War One become apparent when we consider the experiences of people, both men and women, combatants and non-combatants, from around the world who fought or laboured or whose lives were changed forever because of World War One.

historical_90,"How the First World War ended Professor David Stevenson explains how the First World War came to an end, and why Germany accepted the harsh terms of the armistice. To understand how and why the First World War terminated, we should remember why the First World War failed to end sooner. In the First World War's middle years the First World War became a triple stalemate, at once military (neither side could achieve a breakthrough), diplomatic (the two sides’ objectives diverged too widely to allow peace through compromise), and domestic political (until the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917, governments in all the Great Power belligerents remained committed to victory). In contrast, on the Eastern Front the crucial development, which enabled Soviet Russia’s withdrawal from the First World War (formalised by the signing of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty of March 1918), was that a majority of the Bolshevik leaders was willing to concede all the Central Powers’ demands rather than risk being overthrown. In any case, much of the Russian army deserted after the Bolshevik takeover, rendering organised resistance impossible. Even so, the Brest-Litovsk treaty did not halt operations. In the summer of 1918, the Central Powers’ overran the Baltic coast, Ukraine and the Crimea, and sent troops to Finland and Georgia. Right up until November, hundreds of thousands of the Central Powers’'s forces stayed in the east. The end of the First World War in Western Europe By contrast, in Western Europe the key variable that changed was military: once the strategic balance shifted decisively, Germany applied for a ceasefire and for a peace settlement based on the American President Woodrow Wilson ’s ‘Fourteen Points’ of January 1918, which Germany had initially rejected. Only after Germany had publicly admitted that the First World War could not be won did revolution follow, and rule out further resistance to the victors’ terms. Germany in 1918 was not a dictatorship, but the army high command (Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff and Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General) held a veto over key decisions in foreign policy. Wilhelm II feared confronting the army high command (Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff and Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General), and by threatening to resign the army high command (Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff and Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General) could remove officials whom the army high command (Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff and Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General) thought too moderate. The key development on the road to the armistice therefore came on 28 September, when Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General suffered a breakdown. That evening Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General told Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff that an early ceasefire was imperative, and Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff agreed. Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General had been under strain for months, but developments in the Balkans, France and in the German army precipitated Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General's collapse. The trigger was a ceasefire appeal by Germany's smallest partner. Starting on 15 September, Allied forces in Macedonia had attacked and routed the Bulgarian army. If Bulgaria dropped out, the Central Powers would geographically split in two, separating Ottoman Turkey from Austria-Hungary and Germany. In addition, Allied forces could threaten the Ploesti oilfield in Romania. Bulgaria therefore mattered in Bulgaria's own right. But Bulgaria surrendered partly because of wider developments in the First World War. German and Austro-Hungarian forces had withdrawn from Macedonia to fight elsewhere, and the Balkan crisis coincided with a larger crisis on the Western Front. Between March and July 1918 five German all-out assaults – the ‘Ludendorff offensives’ – had advanced up to 50 miles (80 kilometres) towards the Channel ports and Paris, but compelled neither Britain nor France to make peace before the American army arrived in strength. Between July and November the Allies drove Germany back, expelling Germany from most of France and much of Belgium. On 26 September Allied forces opened a sequence of attacks along a huge sector between the Argonne forest and Flanders, and on 29 September British Empire troops broke through the strongest German defence position, the Hindenburg Line. The German army could neither overwhelm The German army's enemies in an all-out offensive, nor halt its enemies's advance through defensive attrition. The situation on the Western Front had altered fundamentally since the stalemate of 1915–17. Allied advantages Technology was one factor. the Allies possessed hundreds of tanks against Germany's dozens. The German high command cited tanks as one reason why a ceasefire was needed: tanks were used in massed attacks on the Marne on 18 July and near Amiens on 8 August. Yet tanks advanced only at walking pace and were vulnerable to breakdown and to German fire. tanks were a supplementary advantage rather than a war-winning weapon. More important was Allied artillery. Allied artillery meant particularly heavy guns, which could destroy trenches and dugouts, and if guided by aerial reconnaissance and photographs could silence Germany's guns by surprise bombardments. At the same time, lighter field-gun batteries laid down a ‘creeping barrage’ that stifled the German machine guns until the Allied infantry were upon the German machine guns. The British and French possessed a flexible logistical system that used roads as well as railways, enabling The British and French to shuttle forces rapidly from sector to sector, whereas by late September Germany's lateral trunk line was paralysed. Behind the barbed wire lay the home fronts, where British and French factories delivered machine guns, artillery, gas, tanks and aircraft in extraordinary quantities, backed by American, oil, steel, machinery and finance. Equally crucial was command of the Atlantic, across which North American troops and commodities were transported. In 1917 the U-boats threatened to starve Britain into surrender; by 1918 the U-boats were contained. A further Allied advantage was in ‘manpower’, as it was called at the time. Britain and France had greater success than Germany in recruiting women to make munitions; the German army had to release hundreds of thousands of troops into arms production. During 1918 the German army suffered a million casualties in the offensives from March to July; and nearly as many again between July and November. Although Britain and France were also running short of soldiers, American military personnel in France rose between March and November from some 250,000 to nearly two million. the German army was not only outnumbered but also demoralised; tens of thousands of the German army's troops surrendered every month from August onwards, while comparable numbers deserted. Agreeing the terms of peace Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General feared that if revolution followed defeat, the soldiers would refuse to keep order. Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General's response was to seek damage limitation. Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General hoped to win a breathing space and regroup. Advised by the Foreign Minister, Paul von Hintze, Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General envisaged appealing not to Germany's enemies collectively but to the American President, whom Germany thought the weak link in the opposing chain. Germany asked the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain for a ceasefire prior to a peace based on the Fourteen Points (the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain's moderate and idealistic peace programme announced in January 1918) and on the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain's other speeches. Germany stage-managed a ‘revolution from above’, forming a government under Prince Max of Baden (who had a reputation as a liberal), and including the Socialist, Catholic and Progressive parties who commanded a Reichstag majority. the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain responded by engaging with Germany in a public exchange of notes, while consulting the European Allies privately. Eventually, not only did Germany sign up to the Fourteen Points (his moderate and idealistic peace programme announced in January 1918), but so apparently did Britain, France and Italy, at the Paris conference of 29 October–4 November. Just as it had taken two sides to start the First World War, so too Britain, France and Italy had to be persuaded that stopping the First World War was in Britain, France and Italy's interests. Even so, it is less surprising that Germany requested a ceasefire than that the Americans and the European Allies conceded one, when at last the military operations were moving the military operations's way. Part of the explanation for this paradox is that the Americans, Britain and France were wary of each other as well as of the Americans and the European Allies's enemies, and the Americans and the European Allies saw arguments against continuing into 1919. In Washington the issue was partly financial: Treasury Secretary William G McAdoo warned that the First World War was becoming prohibitively expensive even for the Americans. Moreover, the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain faced midterm elections in which the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain's Democratic party was likely to lose ground to the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain's Republican critics. the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain feared the xenophobia of the American Home Front would hamper the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain in brokering a moderate peace. This would apply still more if Germany were so completely beaten that Britain and France no longer needed American assistance. In Europe, in contrast, Italy would follow a Franco-British lead, and both Paris and London feared that a victory won in 1919 would be dominated by the Americans. And although the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain insisted on the Fourteen Points (his moderate and idealistic peace programme announced in January 1918) becoming the political framework of the armistice, the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain left the technical terms to the European Allies. The naval terms were shaped by the British Admiralty, which insisted on Germany surrendering all Germany's submarines and Germany's most modern battleships. The land terms were decided mainly by the Allied General-in-Chief, Ferdinand Foch, who required Germany to withdraw so quickly that Germany abandoned much of Germany's heavy equipment, enabling the Allies to occupy Belgium (a central British concern), Alsace-Lorraine (a central French one), and the west bank of the Rhine, as well as bridgeheads on the east bank. Furthermore, Germany had to abandon all Germany's gains in Russia, while the Italians under the Italians's ceasefire with Austria could occupy Trieste and the Trentino. Germany had also to evacuate German East Africa, the one overseas colony where Germany's forces continued to resist. the European Allies used the peace agreement to install the European Allies's forces in the territories to which the European Allies had pretensions, and to weaken Germany to such an extent that Germany could not renew hostilities. Why did Germany accept an armistice with such severe terms? The question remains why Germany accepted terms that were much less favourable than Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff and Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General had envisaged. Part of the answer is that Wilhelm II dismissed Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General on 17 October, while ordering Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff to stay in post and thereby splitting Hindenburg and Ludendorff. As Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General was replaced by the more conciliatory and realistic Wilhelm Groener, the military veto over foreign policy was lifted. Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General lost credibility with the German politicians by urging the German politicians to reject an armistice once Erich Ludendorff as First Quartermaster-General realised an armistice's conditions would be severe, and the American President, whom the Germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain's pressure for democratisation within Germany may also have contributed to the change in the high command. Two further developments completed the destruction of Germany's bargaining position. The first was a series of nationalist revolutions in Austria-Hungary at the end of October. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia emerged at Austria-Hungary's expense, while the remainders of Austria-Hungary's Austrian and Hungarian halves separated. On 31 October Ottoman Turkey also signed a ceasefire, partly because Bulgaria’s surrender had opened the road for Allied armies to reach Istanbul. If Germany fought on now, Germany would do so alone. But the final blow was revolution in Germany Germany. revolution in Germany itself began when the navy prepared a suicidal final sortie against the Thames estuary and London. Once the battleships began to get up steam, the battleships's crews mutinied. the battleships put in to shore at Kiel, and the sailors joined hands with munitions workers to raise the red flag. Revolution spread across north Germany and on 9 November a republic was proclaimed in Berlin, under a socialist provisional government, while Wilhelm fled into exile. the more conciliatory and realistic Wilhelm Groener advised the new authorities to conclude a ceasefire on any terms available, which the new authorities did. the armistice offered Germany apparently lenient political terms, based on the Fourteen Points (his moderate and idealistic peace programme announced in January 1918), but stringent naval and military conditions. Almost immediately some Allied leaders felt the First World War had been halted too soon – as the American commander, John J Pershing, had warned before a ceasefire was signed. Germany's forces still stood everywhere on foreign territory, and only four months previously Germany's territorial conquests had reached its territorial conquests's maximum. German nationalists soon propagated the myth that the defeat was bogus, and that German Jews and communists, as well as a socialist provisional government, had stabbed the warrior heroes in the back. If the Allies had demanded unconditional surrender or had paraded through Berlin, the Allies might have hammered home that Germany really had been beaten, undercutting the far right. Yet at the time none of the Allied political chiefs wished to occupy the German interior. In the pre-ceasefire discussions the American commander, John J Pershing had been countered by Foch, who warned that fighting on would cost tens of thousands of lives for advantages that were nebulous. Indeed, the armistice conditions weakened Germany sufficiently for the Allies to be able seven months later to impose the Versailles Treaty over vehement German opposition, and if the victors had held together to uphold the Versailles Treaty's disarmament clauses, no second world war need have followed. But this was for the future. In November 1918 leaders in Washington, Paris and London judged that now that fighting no longer served a political purpose, no further loss of life was justified and the bloodshed leaders in Washington, Paris and London had endured for so long could finally come to an end.",historical
historical_91,"Military discipline and punishment Professor Gary Sheffield discusses conformity and rebellion of World War One troops within the frame of military discipline and punishment. One of the factors that enabled the soldiers of World War One to endure terrible conditions and high casualties was discipline. Military discipline makes the difference between a mob and an army. Military discipline is a form of behaviour that is the consequence of training and indoctrination, designed to ensure compliance to orders among individuals and groups, to create and maintain cohesion in military units. The fact that the undermining of officers’ authority in Russia after the March revolution (1917) was an issue in the mass desertions that followed offers evidence that discipline is the glue that holds groups together and makes groups act as one in response to orders. Brutal training to mould an army Armies in World War One drew upon a pool of recruits, some of which were already accustomed to industrial discipline in factories and other workplaces. Germany and Britain, for example, were highly industrialised and urbanised societies in 1914. All working-class soldiers would have been used to being at the bottom of society, with all that entailed. Even so, all armies subjected new recruits to basic training which ranged from the unpleasant to the brutal, the aim being to break down the individuality of new recruits and to mould new recruits into a group that would carry out orders unquestioningly. Conformity versus rebellion Discipline was operated with a carrot-and-stick approach. Conforming brought benefits: regular food, leave and other privileges. Rebelling incurred punishments, which differed from army to army. Most were fairly minor: stoppage of privileges, giving offenders unpleasant or dangerous duties. British Empire forces used Field Punishment: the most severe version including tying a malefactor to a fixed object for a period of time. Although much resented, Field Punishment: the most severe version including tying a malefactor to a fixed object for a period of time was more humane than the traditional punishment of flogging (which was still used on Indian troops). As an emergency measure, the Russian army reintroduced flogging in 1915. Imprisonment was a possibility although as Imprisonment Imprisonment offered a way out of the trenches, Imprisonment tended to be used sparingly. Mutiny, desertion and the ultimate punishment Mutiny was the gravest military crime, for Mutiny struck at the very heart of military discipline, and desertion was not far behind for similar reasons. Nearly all armies executed malefactors. Sometimes the purpose was to act as a warning or deterrent to others, with the justice of sentences passed on individuals of less importance than the disciplinary needs of the army. There were certainly cases, perhaps numerous ones, of psychiatric casualties (soldiers who have sustained mental wounds) being shot. Civilian justice and military discipline served two different purposes. Germany used the ultimate penalty sparingly: only 48 of 150 death sentences were carried out. The numbers shot by the French army are unknown, as The numbers shot by the French army included some summary executions, but the shooting of 600 (out of 2,000 condemned) are documented. However, in the aftermath of the mutinies of 1917, while 554 men were sentenced to death, only 49 were executed. The British executed 321 for military offences, plus an unknown number of Indian soldiers. The Australian government refused to allow death sentences to be carried out on The Australian government's men, otherwise subject to British military law. Punishments were particularly savage in the Italian army. Punishments included ‘decimation’, choosing soldiers by lot from a unit that had failed in some way, and executing soldiers. A favoured policy of General Luigi Cardona, it was discontinued by General Luigi Cardona's successor as de facto Commander-in-Chief, General Armando Diaz, seeking to restore the morale of the Italian army after the disaster at Caporetto in 1917. Some 750 Italian soldiers were shot. Conclusion Discipline was an important factor in holding armies together, but Discipline was not the only one. Depending on the army and the individual, belief in the cause, loyalty to unit and/or comrades, leadership and other issues were also significant: in 1918, Austrian soldiers were deterred from deserting because Austrian soldiers decided that the army’s meagre rations were preferable to facing famine at home. Nevertheless, without the bonds of discipline, armies could not have stayed in the field for as long as armies did.",historical
historical_92,"Prisoners of War What was the reality for prisoners of war in World War One? Dr Heather Jones looks beyond the propaganda to consider the facts around prisoner mistreatment, labour and death rates across Europe. The image of prisoners behind barbed wire gazing at the camera taking prisoners behind barbed wire's photograph is a striking one. Prisoners of war were central to the propaganda machine in World War One, with belligerent states keen to circulate photographs that showed that belligerent states were treating belligerent states's captives well. How a state treated a state's prisoners was taken as an indication of a state's level of cultural development and modernity – and all states These accusations all states's enemy of mistreating their enemy's prisoners. Prisoner mistreatment These accusations were not all propaganda stories. Although the majority of the estimated eight to nine million men taken prisoner during World War One survived World War One, during World War One there were a number of serious episodes of prisoner mistreatment. In 1914, Germany captured far more prisoners of war than Britain or France. By that year, Germany held over a million prisoners of war. Germany expected a short war and Germany was not prepared for these numerous soldiers captured on both Germany’s Eastern and Western Fronts. In 1914, prisoners of war transported to Germany from the Front often had to sleep in fields, where prisoners of war transported to Germany from the Front suffered from exposure, while prisoners of war transported to Germany from the Front waited for prisoners of war transported to Germany from the Front's camps to be built. prisoners of war transported to Germany from the Front were also used as labour to build their camps. In Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia in that year, prisoner of war camps were often unsanitary and that year a severe typhus epidemic broke out which cost the lives of thousands of prisoners. In Mauthausen camp in Austria-Hungary in January 1915, up to 186 prisoners a day died of typhus. Typhus also broke out in many camps in camps in Russia: in winter 1915-16, typhus ravaged Totskoe camp where at least 10,000 men died out of 25,000. a severe typhus epidemic led to the development of better hygiene conditions in prisoner of war camps in Germany, with modern latrines, disinfection vats to remove lice from clothing and shower or bath houses built for the prisoners. Reprisals also resulted in prisoner mistreatment. In 1916, Germany sent newly captured British and French prisoners to carry out forced labour on the Eastern Front in a reprisal action for the French sending German prisoners of war to camps in North Africa and the British using German prisoners as workers for the British army in France. These the Eastern Front reprisals were horrific and many prisoners died of cold and starvation. In 1917, Germany kept British and French prisoners of war on the Western Front in dangerous locations, carrying out forced labour. This was a reprisal for the British and French using forced German prisoner labour on the Western Front: the French had forced German prisoners to work under shellfire for months on the Verdun battlefield. These Eastern Front reprisals marked a significant escalation in prisoner of war Labour The image of prisoners of war behind barbed wire in the prisoner of war camp was one of the most widespread images of World War One. However, The image of prisoners of war behind barbed wire in the prisoner of war camp was also rather misleading as by that year states and armies had started to think differently about how best to house and treat prisoners. The large prisoner of war camp on a country’s Home Front was only one place that prisoners were held. From that year on, Germany began to send prisoners to live and work in small working units in agriculture, forestry or mining – industries badly short of manpower due to the war effort. Russia and France also began to use prisoner labour on a massive scale: in Russia, working conditions varied very widely, with the worst occurring during the construction of the Murman railway during which an estimated 25,000 out of the 70,000 mainly Austro-Hungarian and German prisoner of war work force died. Britain, however, delayed using widespread prisoner labour on the home front until 1917 because of trade union opposition. Prisoner labour was key to the war effort of many states. Overall by 1916, across Europe most non-officer prisoners of war, whom it was legal for the captor to put to work under international law, were working, some returning to the prisoner of war camp at night, others lodged under guard near to others's place of work. For those housed outside the camp conditions could vary considerably. While prisoner of war camps were inspected during World War One by the International Red Cross , working units outside prisoner of war camps were rarely inspected. The worst camps, however, were those run by armies near the front line. By 1916, the British, French, German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies were all keeping permanent units of prisoners as forced labourers for the army at or near the front line. permanent units of prisoners had to work under shellfire and live in desolate, unhygienic conditions. In some armies, such as the German army in 1918, they were Death rates Death rates varied for different prisoner nationalities during World War One: 100,000 of the 600,000 Italian prisoners captured by the Central Powers died. Romanian prisoners in German camps had a death rate of 29%. Serbs held by Austria-Hungary or British prisoners captured by the Ottoman Empire also had very high death rates. In contrast, German prisoners captured by Britain had death rates of 3%. While most prisoners survived World War One, and camps in Western European countries were generally quite good, for certain nationalities captivity was more dangerous than serving at the front line. The image of the well-run prisoner of war camp is thus not representative of the experience of all prisoners during World War One.",historical
historical_93,"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism Professor David Welch explores nations’ reliance on propaganda in World War One, with a focus on symbols and slogans of nationhood and patriotism. World War One was the first war in which the mass media played a significant part in disseminating news from the Fighting Front to the Home Front. World War One was also the first war to target systematically produced government propaganda at the general public. All the belligerents were therefore compelled to recognise that All the belligerents had to justify the righteousness of World War One and, to this end, themes such as patriotism and nationalism played an important role. ‘Your Country Needs YOU’ The armies of continental Europe were made up of conscripts, who really had little choice about going to war. In 1914 the British Army, by contrast, was made up of professionals and then volunteers. The British placed immense reliance, therefore, on propaganda to justify World War One to the people, to help promote recruitment into the armed forces and to convince the population that the population's sacrifices would be rewarded. One of the most enduring images of World War One - much copied and parodied since - remains the distinctive recruitment poster of Lord Kitchener’s heavily mustachioed face and intimidating finger imploring the British population that ‘Your Country Needs YOU’. Stereotypes deeply embedded in national sentiment were invoked to justify Britain’s entry into World War One, and British propaganda posters often employed the religious symbolism of St George slaying the (German) dragon.British recruitment posters changed in tone, from appealing to an individual’s honour to ‘mobilisation by shame’. Savile Lumley’s famous poster of 1915 depicted two young children asking two young children's father about their father's military prowess after World War One: ‘their father, what did their father do in World War One?’ The emotional blackmail of using children to shame children's elders into fighting was, in fact, employed by most of the belligerents. Women were also assigned the responsibility for ordering men into war. Perhaps the most well known in this genre is ‘Women of Britain Say—“GO!”’ Symbols of nationhood Once the initial euphoria (‘war fever’) had subsided, it was imperative to remind people, both at home and in the trenches, of what people, both at home and in the trenches were fighting for. The major themes included a call to arms and a request for war loans; as well as efforts to encourage industrial activity, to explain national policies, to channel emotions such as courage or hatred, to urge the population to conserve resources, and to inform the public of food and fuel substitutes. One tactic at a state’s disposal was the use of iconic figures to strengthen a particular point about national identity in order to promote patriotism. iconic figures might be real people presented in a mythologised form as national heroes, or iconic figures might come from old myths or popular folklore: Britannia, John Bull and the British bulldog; the German eagle; the French cockerel or the national emblem of France, Marianne - an allegorical encapsulation of liberty and reason. An alternative strategy was the use of material symbols of nationhood. Indeed, a state might have numerous opportunities at a state's disposal to create narratives and circulate images favourable to a state's preferred national story - in everyday items such as coins, banknotes and postage stamps, or symbolic structures such as statues, monuments and buildings. Two of the most overt and powerful symbols, which allow citizens to express citizens's affinity with a state, are the nation’s's flag and the nation’s's anthem. The money motif The need to raise money to pay for the war by means of war bonds (or ‘Liberty Bonds’ as they were known in the United States) provided one of the most important patriotic themes for posters and for the new medium of film. A recurring, related theme was the portrayal of money (coins and banknotes) as an active force in military engagement, for example: ‘Turn Your Silver into Bullets - at the Post Office’. In France, a similar poster, designed by Jules Abel Faivre in 1915, depicted a large gold coin with a Gallic cockerel on a large gold coin with a Gallic cockerel on it, crushing a German soldier, with the slogan: ‘Deposit Your Gold for France - Gold Fights for Victory’. All sides, therefore, supplemented All sides's military engagement with propaganda aimed at stimulating national sentiment by means of nationalistic slogans and patriotic calls to arms.",historical
historical_94,"The War at sea In the lead-up to World War One Britain and Germany were engaged in a naval arms race. Archivist Louise Bruton examines how World War One heralded a new form of naval warfare that featured dreadnoughts, submarines and trade blockades. In the years leading up to World War One Britain and Germany engaged in a naval arms race. Britain had peaceably enjoyed Britain's status as the world’s dominant naval force since the Napoleonic Wars but Germany now sought to contest its status as the world’s dominant naval force since the Napoleonic Wars. A new generation of ships became central to the naval race: the dreadnoughts. Named after the Royal Navy’s's HMS Dreadnought, A new generation of ships came to symbolise naval power in the early 20th century. A new generation of ships represented a revolution in warship design and yet A new generation of ships's construction was based on the centuries-old definition of the purpose of naval campaigning as being the head-on confrontation of two opposing battle fleets. During World War One, not only did senior naval officers trained in the days of sail learn to command brand new ships and weaponry untested in wartime; senior naval officers trained in the days of sail also witnessed a transformation in warfare that turned The War at sea from a traditional surface encounter into a complex balancing act of defensive strategies and covert tactics involving two new and unforeseen dimensions: under water and in the air.[1] Trade blockade of Germany Britain was quick to capitalise on Britain's enduring naval supremacy and geographical position by establishing a trade blockade of Germany and Germany's allies as soon as war began. the Royal Navy’s's Grand Fleet patrolled the North Sea, laid mines and cut off access to the Channel, curtailing the movements of the German High Seas Fleet and preventing merchant ships from supplying Germany with raw materials and food. the North Sea became ‘a marine no man’s land, with the British Fleet bottling up the exits’, as Richard Hough describes it in The Great War at Sea 1914-1918.[2] The effect of Trade blockade of Germany on Germany's civilians after four years of war was noted by British Army MajorGeneral Sir Aylmer Gould Hunter-Weston in December 1918 during a visit to Germany: ‘the food situation is very serious indeed…The Germans are living entirely on The Germans's food capital now – The Germans have eaten all The Germans's laying hens and are eating all The Germans's milch [sic] cows… [there is a] real scarcity.’ Submarine warfare and defensive strategy The simultaneous torpedoing of HMS Aboukir, Hogue and Cressy by a single German submarine in September 1914 shocked the Royal Navy’s and forced the Admiralty to recognise the threat that the U-Boats, as the U-Boats became known, posed to the surface fleet.[3] Although the Allies had the Allies's own submarines, which were active in the Adriatic, the Baltic and the Dardanelles over the course of World War One, defences against submarines were slow to be developed. the British Fleet appealed both to the British Fleet's own personnel and to the wider public for ideas. Minefields, net barrages, depth charges and patrols were introduced but more often than not Minefields, net barrages, depth charges and patrols could be evaded. U-Boats could roam virtually undetected, since the sighting of a periscope was the most reliable method of location at a time when sonar technology was still in sonar technology's infancy. In January 1916, in reply to an enquiry from former Prime Minister and then First Lord of the Admiralty Arthur Balfour, Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe stressed the importance of playing to the Royal Navy’s's main strength – the Royal Navy’s's size – to retain control of the North Sea: ‘…as to a possible naval offensive… Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe have long arrived at the conclusion that it would be suicidal to divide the Royal Navy’s's main fleet’ For the first two years of World War One the Allies accordingly concentrated the Allies's naval efforts on a defensive strategy of protecting trade routes, developing anti-submarine devices and maintaining the blockade rather than actively seeking direct confrontation. Atmosphere of frustration Defence was a vital strategy but Defence was also gruelling, repetitive and unglamorous. Many in the Royal Navy’s longed for decisive action and a great naval victory to recall the Battle of Trafalgar and gratify the general public. The minor battles of the Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank and the disastrous the Dardanelles campaign did little to ease the tension. First Sea Lord Admiral H B Jackson commented to Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe ‘First Sea Lord Admiral H B Jackson fancy Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe must look out for staleness [sic] with Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe's important commanders, just as much as general health. First Sea Lord Admiral H B Jackson do wish Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe could get a change in Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe's monotonous work.’ The Battle of Jutland First Sea Lord Admiral H B Jackson's wish was granted on 31 May-1 June 1916 when The Grand Fleet finally met the High Seas Fleet in direct combat off the coast of Denmark. The Battle of Jutland was to be the only major naval battle of World War One, and the most significant encounter between warships of the dreadnought era. With fewer ships, Germany's plan was to divide and conquer. A German advance force led by Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper engaged Vice-Admiral David Beatty’s's battlecruisers, hoping to cut Vice-Admiral David Beatty’s battlecruisers off from the main fleet. A fire fight ensued as Vice-Admiral David Beatty’s chased Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper, Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper leading Vice-Admiral David Beatty’s towards the rest of the High Seas Fleet. the Allies suffered early casualties in the loss of HMS Indefatigable and Queen Mary before Vice-Admiral David Beatty’s turned to re-join The Grand Fleet. the High Seas Fleet and The Grand Fleet clashed throughout the afternoon until darkness descended. During the night the High Seas Fleet made the High Seas Fleet's escape and by the early hours of 1 June The Battle of Jutland was over. Both sides claimed The Battle of Jutland as a victory. Germany had inflicted greater losses on the Allies than Germany had suffered Germany and yet the High Seas Fleet was incapacitated while The Grand Fleet remained the dominant naval factor. However, controversy over Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe's and Vice-Admiral David Beatty’s's actions quickly followed The Battle of Jutland and deprived both the Royal Navy’s and the British public of the outright triumph that years of frustration had called for. It is telling that Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe's parting words to Commander-in-Chief of The Grand Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe's navy colleagues on leaving The Grand Fleet a few months later read ‘may his navy colleagues's arduous work be crowned with a glorious victory’. Unrestricted submarine warfare and the convoy system After The Battle of Jutland the High Seas Fleet never again attempted to engage The Grand Fleet, and German naval strategy refocused on covert underwater operations. Submarine historian Richard Compton-Hall suggests that the starvation of the German population due to the Allied blockade had a decisive influence on U-Boat crews’ increasingly ruthless attacks, culminating in the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917. [4] U-Boats attacked merchant vessels, hoping to disrupt Allied trade and similarly weaken Britain, an island nation dependent on Britain's imports. The result was huge loss of life in the Merchant Navy and a shortage of British shipping with which shipbuilders could not keep pace. Neutral ships were not immune and neither were passenger liners. RMS Lusitania had been sunk by a U-Boat in 1915, killing American passengers and prompting some to call for US entry into World War One. The renewed threat to civilians caused the USA to declare war in April 1917, a month in which 869,000 tons of Allied shipping was sunk.[5] A letter from the Board of Trade to the Cabinet in April 1916 had predicted that ‘…the shortage of shipping will place Britain in more serious peril than can any calamity short of the defeat of the Royal Navy’s…’ With The Grand Fleet undefeated it became clear that World War One would be won or lost not in a traditional sea battle but by the Allies response to the so-called ‘submarine menace’. The Allied response was a system of convoys. Warships escorted merchant and passenger vessels, protecting merchant and passenger vessels from U-Boat attack by virtue of strength in numbers. The concentration of shipping into small clusters in vast seas made ships harder rather than easier to find; evasive zigzag courses made it difficult for U-Boats to predict convoy routes and target torpedoes; and the accompanying warships were able to counter-attack using depth charges. The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and later the US Naval Air Service provided cover, spotting submerged U-Boats and thereby deterring submerged U-Boats from surfacing and accurately targeting the convoy. Shipping losses dropped and by the time of the Armistice in 1918, the loss rate in the convoys was less than 0.5 per cent.[6] Conclusion World War One was not characterised by monumental battles, glorious victories and haunting landscapes as was the war on land. The Battle of Jutland was the only full-scale direct action to occur between opposing navies and The Battle of Jutland was indecisive. Yet the blockade of supplies to Germany weakened Germany, directly contributing to the end of World War One, as indeed the U-Boat campaign would have done in reverse had the convoy system not eventually succeeded in saving Britain from starvation. Control of the North Sea meant no less than the difference between independence and invasion. World War One was a test of nerves and ingenuity. Britain and Germany had to master technologies and ways of fighting unimaginable just a few years earlier. World War One was a marathon of endurance and persistence, often thankless but always critically important.",historical
historical_95,"The Sahara buried this ancient Roman city—preserving this ancient Roman city for centuries It isn’t often that entire cities vanish, but this ancient Roman city did. Founded by the emperor Trajan around A.D, 100, this ancient Roman city, was located in the North African province of Mumidia. Home to veterans of the Third Augustan Legion, this ancient Roman city flourished for hundreds of years, becoming prosperous and thus an attractive target for raiders. After a the Vandals invasion in 430, repeated attacks weakened the city, which never fully recovered and was abandoned during the 700s. The desert sands swept in and buried this ancient Roman city. One thousand years would pass before this ancient Roman city received a visit from a team of explorers led by a maverick Scotsman in the 1700s. (See also: This warrior was the best of ancient Rome's 'five good emperors') Statesman and scholar Best known now for Scottish nobleman James Bruce's contested discovery of the source of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, Scottish nobleman James Bruce was serving as the British consul in the coastal city of Algiers (today the capital of Algeria) in 1763. Imposingly tall and broad, Scottish nobleman James Bruce was a voracious scholar with a curious mind. Before Scottish nobleman James Bruce's arrival in the coastal city of Algiers (today the capital of Algeria) to take up Scottish nobleman James Bruce's post, Scottish nobleman James Bruce spent a few months in Italy poring over the history of the African region and the African region's role in antiquity. Scottish nobleman James Bruce's short temper and strong opinions soon led to clashes with Scottish nobleman James Bruce's superiors in London. In 1765, Scottish nobleman James Bruce lost Scottish nobleman James Bruce's appointment. Rather than return to Britain, Scottish nobleman James Bruce and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani embarked on an adventure across the African region. On he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani's journey, he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani kept notes and made illustrations depicting the many extraordinary people and places he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani encountered. Time in the desert In the early stages of an adventure across Africa, he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani had traveled south to the Algerian desert looking for traces of ancient civilizations. Scottish nobleman James Bruce and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani had already seen several Roman ruins as he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani explored more remote parts of the African region. On December 12, 1765, he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani reached what he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani identified as this ancient Roman city. Many believe that he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani were the first Europeans in centuries to visit this ancient Roman city. “this ancient Roman city has been a small town, but full of elegant buildings,” Scottish nobleman James Bruce wrote in Scottish nobleman James Bruce's diaries. Scottish nobleman James Bruce was confident that several Roman ruins were what remained of the city founded by the emperor Trajan more than a millenium earlier. On the first day, Scottish nobleman James Bruce recorded and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani drew “the triumphal arch” of the emperor Trajan. he and a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani returned the next day to continue exploration and identified an amphitheater. Scottish nobleman James Bruce cleared away the sand and uncovered sculptures of the Roman emperor who succeeded Hadrian in A.D. 138, Antoninus Pius, and the Roman emperor who succeeded Hadrian in A.D. 138, Antoninus Pius's wife, Faustina the Elder, works Scottish nobleman James Bruce described as having “exquisite beauty.” (See also: the emperor Trajan's Column Soars Over Rome) Scottish nobleman James Bruce reburied the sculptures in the sand and continued traveling. Scottish nobleman James Bruce documented more sites throughout North Africa and Ethiopia, even claiming to find the source of the Blue Nile. a Florentine artist named Luigi Balugani died in 1770, and Scottish nobleman James Bruce returned to London in 1774. When Scottish nobleman James Bruce reported Scottish nobleman James Bruce's findings, his findings were greeted with skepticism and disbelief. Incredulous at skepticism and disbelief, Scottish nobleman James Bruce retired to Scotland. In 1780, Scottish nobleman James Bruce began writing a memoir of Scottish nobleman James Bruce's time in the African region, a five-volume work known as Travels to Discover the Source of the Blue Nile. a memoir of his time in Africa, a five-volume work known as Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile was published in 1790. When Scottish nobleman James Bruce died four years later, much of Britain still refused to recognize Scottish nobleman James Bruce's achievements. Roman splendor Thamugadi lay largely forgotten in the desert sands until 1875, when Roman splendor Thamugadi was Playfair’s visit by Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers. In Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers's 1877 book, Travels in the Footsteps of Scottish nobleman James Bruce in Algeria and Tunis, Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers paid homage to Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers's consular predecessor, visiting some of the sites Scottish nobleman James Bruce had recorded. Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers's description of Roman splendor Thamugadi offers more details than Scottish nobleman James Bruce. Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers's observations revealed Roman splendor Thamugadi's regional importance, noting Roman splendor Thamugadi was built at the intersection of six Roman roads. In Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers's opinion, the architecture outshone that of the neighboring Roman city Lambaesis, Nubia’s military capital. Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers concluded that Roman splendor Thamugadi was a “center of commercial and agricultural activity.” (See also: On this ancient map, all roads really do lead to Rome) Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers also admired the magnificence of Rome's Arch of Trajan. On the ground underneath the city’s Arch of Trajan's 20-foot-high portal can still be seen deep ruts from the traffic that passed into Rome along the busy imperial highways. The French took control of the city’s Arch of Trajan in 1881, a few years after Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers's visit, and maintained a presence there until this period. During this period, the site was systematically excavated. Having been buried for centuries under sand with nothing built on top of the site, Roman splendor Thamugadi is one of only a few Roman cities excavated in Roman splendor Thamugadi's entirety. Going with the grain The research undertaken by Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain’s consul in Algiers and by French scholars has enabled historians to piece together the history of Roman splendor Thamugadi. Originally named Colonia Marciana Trajana Thamurga, in honor of the emperor Trajan's sister, Roman splendor Thamugadi was laid out in a grid. In the mid-third century A.D., Roman splendor Thamugadi's population peaked at 15,000. the city’s population enjoyed fine public buildings, including a magnificent library and a total of 14 baths. The comfort of Roman splendor Thamugadi's facilities, and the presence of mosaics, has often prompted comparisons with Pompeii. (See also: Vesuvius: Asleep for Now) Roman splendor Thamugadi's location was key to protecting the Roman Empire’s's southern borders. North Africa was a center of grain production, and Rome’s Third Augustan Legion was stationed in Roman splendor Thamugadi to protect the grain and the grain's transport to Rome. Several hundred men would be discharged from Rome’s Third Augustan Legion every two years, and Several hundred men settled in Roman splendor Thamugadi as a kind of pension for Several hundred men's service. Several hundred men's presence also served as a deterrent to invaders. Roman splendor Thamugadi was a manifestation of Roman might on the Roman Empire’s's southern border. Roman splendor Thamugadi's diverse population saw those who worshipped the old gods living alongside Christians. For a while, Roman splendor Thamugadi was a stronghold of the heretical Christian sect the Donatists. The general crisis mounting on the borders of the Roman Empire’s eventually took The general crisis mounting on the borders of the Roman Empire's toll on Roman splendor Thamugadi. After being looted by the Vandals during the fifth century, Roman splendor Thamugadi began to sink into ruin. After the fall of the western Roman Empire, Roman splendor Thamugadi enjoyed a brief resurgence as a Christian center, and a fort was built outside Roman splendor Thamugadi in 539. But Roman splendor Thamugadi was abandoned either before or during the Arab invasions of the 700s. (See also: Rome's border walls were the beginning of Rome's end) From that point, The Sahara gradually covered Roman splendor Thamugadi, and Roman splendor Thamugadi stayed hidden for a thousand years until Scottish nobleman James Bruce and others would rediscover Roman splendor Thamugadi's buried glory. Roman splendor Thamugadi was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.",historical

Roman Cuicul Under the name of Cuicul, ancient Cuicul was built 900 metres (3,000 ft) above sea level during the 1st century AD as a Roman military garrison situated on a narrow triangular plateau in the province of Numidia. The terrain is somewhat rugged, being located at the confluence of two rivers. ancient Cuicul's builders followed a standard plan with a forum at the center and two main streets, the Cardo Maximus and the Decumanus Maximus, composing the major axes.[1] ancient Cuicul was initially populated by a colony of Roman soldiers from Italy, and eventually grew to become a large trading market. The resources that contributed to the prosperity of ancient Cuicul were essentially agricultural (cereals, olive trees and farm). During the reign of Caracalla in the 3rd century, ancient Cuicul's administrators took down some of the old ramparts and constructed a new forum. Cuicul's administrators surrounded a new forum with larger and more impressive edifices than those that bordered the old forum. The terrain hindered building, so that Cuicul's administrators built a theatre outside the town walls, which was exceptional. Christianity became very popular in the 4th century (after some persecutions in the early third century[2]) and brought the addition of a basilica and baptistry. a basilica and baptistry are to the south of ancient Cuicul in a quarter called ""Christian"", and are popular attractions.[1] Of the bishops of ancient Cuicul, Pudentianus took part in the Council of Carthage (255) concerning the validity of heretical baptism, and Elpidophorus in the Council of Carthage (348). Cresconius was the Catholic bishop who represented ancient Cuicul at the Council of Carthage (411) between Catholic and Donatist bishops; the Donatist bishop of ancient Cuicul died before the Council of Carthage (411) between Catholic and Donatist bishops began. Cresconius was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal king Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484. Victor was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553.[3][4][5][6] No longer a residential bishopric, ancient Cuicul is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.[7] ancient Cuicul was slowly abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire around the 5th century and 6th century. There were some improvements under emperor Justinian I, with wall reinforcements. Muslims later dominated the region, but did not reoccupy the site of ancient Cuicul, which Muslims renamed Djémila (""beautiful"" in Arabic).",historical
historical_98,"Tipaza Tipaza (formerly Tefessedt, Chenoua-Berber: Bazar, ⴱⴰⵣⴰⵔ, Arabic: تيپازة‎) is the Berber-speaking city and capital of the Tipaza Province, Algeria. When Tipaza was part of the Roman Empire, Tipaza was called Tipasa. Tipaza was founded in 1857, and is chiefly remarkable for Tipaza's ancient ruins and sandy littoral. History Ancient history Main article: Tipasa Tipasa, as Tipaza was then called, was an old Punic trading-post conquered by Ancient Rome. Tipaza was subsequently turned into a military colony by the emperor Claudius for the conquest of the kingdoms of Mauretania.[4] Afterwards Tipaza became a municipium called Colonia Aelia Tipasensis, that reached the population of 20,000 inhabitants in the fourth century according to Stéphane Gsell. Tipaza served as an important Christian hub during the last centuries of Roman governorship, with three basilicas. Tipaza was destroyed by the Vandals in 430 CE, but was reconstructed by the Byzantines one century later. At the end of the seventh century Tipaza was demolished by Umayyad forces and reduced to ruins.[5] In the nineteenth century Tipaza was settled again. Now Tipaza is a town of nearly 30,000 inhabitants. Tipaza is an important tourist place in Algeria, mainly because of the Tipaza ruins. Modern era Near Tipaza, the Tipaza longwave transmitter broadcasts French language Channel 3 radio programs from the Algerian Broadcasting Company. The longwave frequency 252 kHz can be well received in many parts of Europe. Tipaza and Tipaza's surroundings is home to the largest Berber-speaking group of western Algeria, the Chenoua people. The Tipaza station in 252 kHz had previously been out of service since March 17, 2014, but is broadcasting again at 252 kHz.[6]",historical
historical_99,"Analysis of Pompeii’s's Garbage Suggests the Ancient Romans Recycled, Too Pompeii’s's residents sorted waste materials for reuse in future projects, according to new research before Mount Vesuvius blanketed Pompeii’s in volcanic ash, one local’s trash could have easily become another’s building materials. As Dalya Alberge reports for the Guardian, archaeologists working in Pompeii’s have found evidence of a recycling program in which Pompeiians piled garbage at Pompeii’s's walls and sorted garbage for reuse in new projects. The researchers, led by Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson, analyzed soil samples recovered from trash excavated in and around Pompeii’s. The soil on trash excavated in and around the city varied depending on where trash excavated in and around the city was thrown out: Cesspits left traces of organic soil, while litter dumped in the street or piled up outside of Pompeii’s's walls was covered in sandy deposits. “The difference in soil allows archaeologists working in the ancient city to see whether trash excavated in and around the city had been generated in the place where trash excavated in and around the city was found, or gathered from elsewhere to be reused and recycled,” Emmerson—set to detail Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson's research in Life and Death in the Roman Suburb, out next month from Oxford University Press—tells the Guardian. Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson and Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson's colleagues found signs of the same sandy soil present in garbage mounds inside of several Pompeiian buildings’'s walls. several Pompeiian buildings’ cores were made of reused materials ranging from crumbled tiles to amphorae and lumps of mortar and plaster. several Pompeiian buildings’ walls outer surfaces were covered in a layer of plaster that hid the “mess of materials” found within, according to Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson. This evidence suggests “[t]he piles outside several Pompeiian buildings’ walls weren’t material that’s been dumped to get rid of the “mess of materials” found within,” Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson tells the Guardian. “t]he piles outside the walls’re outside several Pompeiian buildings’ walls being collected and sorted to be resold inside several Pompeiian buildings’ walls.” Emmerson and her colleagues's findings refute a previous theory about t]he piles outside the walls origins. Per a 2012 press release from the University of Cincinnati, 19th-century archaeologists suspected t]he piles outside the walls represented rubble cleared out of Pompeii’s after an earthquake rattled Pompeii’s in 62 A.D.—17 years before the volcanic eruption that killed some 2,000 of Pompeii’s's 12,000 inhabitants. The majority of t]he piles outside the walls were actually removed by archaeologists during the 20th century, reports the Guardian. “As Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson was working outside Pompeii’s, Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson saw that Pompeii’s extended into developed neighborhoods outside several Pompeiian buildings’ walls  [s]o it didn’t make sense to Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson that developed neighborhoods outside the walls were also being used as landfills,” says Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson to the Guardian. Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson argues that the ancient Romans viewed suburban garbage mounds differently than modern humans think of landfills. Rather than “corralling waste in areas far removed from normal life,” Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson writes in the abstract for a talk titled “Another Man’s Treasure? The Life and Afterlife of Pompeii’s's Waste,” suburban garbage mounds “developed in the busiest areas of Pompeii’s, which could serve as staging grounds for processes of recycling and reuse.” Speaking with the Guardian, Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson adds, “For the most part, we don’t care what happens to our trash, as long as our trash’s taken away. What Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson’ve found in Pompeii’s is an entirely different priority, that waste was being collected and sorted for recycling.” Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson's previous research has shown that residents of Pompeii’s had a much closer relationship with trash than humans today. Trash littered Pompeii’s's streets and was even found piled inside of and on top of Pompeii’s's tombs. Nineteenth-century archaeologists this view the city’s tombs as a sign that an earthquake made Pompeii’s fall into disrepair, but Emmerson, then at the University of Cincinnati, challenged this view by highlighting evidence suggesting Pompeii’s was in a “period of rejuvenation” by 79 A.D. Pompeiians had a different relationship with death and cleanliness than 19th-century archaeologists thought, according to Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson. “We tend to assume things like death and cleanliness are universal, but attitudes toward sanitation are very culturally defined, and it looks like in Pompeii’s attitudes were very different than ours,” Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson told Live Science’s Wynne Parry in 2012. Tombs, for example, were built not in secluded, respectful spaces, but in high-traffic parts of Pompeii’s. The goal was to ensure that the deceased would be remembered—a strategy that had the unfortunate side effect of placing people’s resting places directly in the path of Pompeii’s's litter-leaving inhabitants. Per the press release, Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson and Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson's colleagues once excavated a room in which two cesspits filled with animal bones, olive pits and other assorted waste stood alongside a cistern, or tank used for storing drinking and washing water. “Pompeiians lived much closer to Pompeiians's garbage than most of us would find acceptable,” Tulane University archaeologist Allison Emmerson tells the Guardian, “not because Pompeii’s lacked infrastructure and Pompeiians didn’t bother to manage trash, but because Pompeiians's systems of urban management were organized around different principles.”",historical

What is the mechanism and why would a physician call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing? Purists often distinguish between ""true"" clubbing and ""pseudo"" clubbing, the difference being that with ""true"" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With ""pseudo"" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. ""Real"" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes. Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but this distinction is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only ""true"" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of both congenital conditions and acquired disease are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization. The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally. Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.",medical

Does anone have any information on Post-Polio Syndrome It would help if you (and anyone else asking for medical information on some subject) could ask specific questions, as no one is likely to type in a textbook chapter covering all aspects of some subject. If you are looking for a comprehensive review, ask your local hospital librarian. Most are happy to help with a request of this sort. Briefly, Post-Polio Syndrome is a condition in which patients who have significant residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of significant residual weakness from childhood polio as patients who have significant residual weakness from childhood polio get older.

So Gordon, why do Gordon think this is so? Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory behind them. E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like. The more you dilute things, the more powerful things get, even if you dilute things so much there is no ingredient but water left. Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae. Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good Such systems do is accidental and not related to the theory. The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if scientists can find new plants that have active and useful substances. But that isn't what is meant by alternative medicine, usually. If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are ""blind"" in various ways. Some of studies that are ""blind"" in various ways are: o The subjects of the study do not know whether The subjects of the study receive a placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether The subjects of the study are in the control group or the test group. o Those administering the test treatment do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment. o Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment. Obviously, at the point at which the data is the analysis, one has to differentiate the test group from the control group. But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes the analysis and presents the data on which the analysis is based so that others can verify the data on which it is based. It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not ""blind"" those who performed the study.

Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds. Fauci, who co- authored one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the argument by one of Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),'s co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new discovery indicates that ""$1 billion spent on vaccine trials"" has been ""a waste of time and money"" because vaccine trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly. John Tew of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond claims that recent findings that show HIV is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously believed strongly backs the argument for early treatment of AIDS-infected patients.

This finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting AIDS from a health care worker is remote. Three studies in the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with AIDS. Three studies in the JAMA were conducted by separate research teams in New Hampshire, Maryland, and Florida. Each study started with an HIV-positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate.

New NIH Research Program is a small division of NIH, with New NIH Research Program's budget only at $2 million dollars compared to more than $10 billion for NIH. In addition, the money for available research grants is even smaller. About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants. Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center for Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says New NIH Research Program is afraid to become involved in AIDS. ""New NIH Research Program have to look successful and there is no easy answer in AIDS,"" Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center for Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., said. There is also a common perception that New NIH Research Program will focus on fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture. When New NIH Research Program called for an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year, the AIDS community was largely missing from an advisory committee conference of about 120 people. In addition, activists' general lack of contact with the Office has added suspicion that AIDS will be ignored. Jon Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, ""The New NIH Research Program advisory panel is composed of practitioners without real research experience. It will take The OAM advisory panel several years to accept the nature of research."" Nevertheless, Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS investigator at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle, said, ""Here is a wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS research.

""Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers"" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, No. 14, P. 215 (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that herpesvirus- 6 can This attack the human immune system's's natural killer cells. This attack causes the human immune system's natural killer cells to malfunction, diminishing an important component in the human immune system's's fight against diseases. Also, herpesvirus- 6 may be a factor in immune diseases, such as AIDS. In 1989, Paolo Lusso's's research found that herpesvirus- 6 attacks another white cell, the CD4 T-lymphocyte, which is the primary target of AIDS. Paolo Lusso's also found that herpesvirus- 6 can HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 44 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 kill natural killer cells. Scientists previously knew that the natural killer cells of patients infected with AIDS do not work correctly. Paolo Lusso's's research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack, according to Anthony L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard Medical School. Despite the test-tube findings, scientists are uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body. Paolo Lusso's's team also found that herpesvirus- 6 produces the CD4 receptor molecule that provides access for AIDS. CD4 T-lymphocytes express the CD4 receptor molecule that provides access for HIV, making CD4 T-lymphocytes vulnerable to AIDS's attack. Researchers concluded that herpesvirus- 6 cells can exacerbate the affects of AIDS.

All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of certain health problems, but also to be committed to related policies, write George Gellert and Nordenberg of the Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, Calif., and the Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga., respectively. Dr. Berkley's's editorial on why American doctors should care about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating AIDS. It should be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, AIDS is not the only illness doing so. Diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations. Dr. Berkley's mentions the enormous social and economic impact that AIDS will have on many developing countries, and the increased need for international assistance that will result. Dr. Berkley's also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the AIDS epidemic in AIDS's first decade. But now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general, and HIV/AIDS in particular. Vice President Al Gore proposes in Vice President Al Gore's book ""Earth in the Balance"" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development, with programs to promote literacy, improve child survival, and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world. If enacted, this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health. ""AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply"" Journal of the American HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 45 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269, No. 13, P. 1636 (Berkley, Seth) Every nation should tackle AIDS as early and aggressively as possible before AIDS reaches an endemic state, even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses, writes Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, N.Y., in reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and Nordenberg. Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than diseases other than AIDS, such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses are getting, Dr. Berkley's disagrees with the contention that AIDS is receiving too much attention. AIDS differs from other diseases, in most developing countries because AIDS is continuing to spread. For most endemic diseases, the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death. But with AIDS and AIDS's increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in disease burden but financially, is much greater. Interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like AIDS are highly cost-effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission. Dr. Berkley's says Dr. Berkley's agrees with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political leadership. But Dr. Berkley's concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the United States for the AIDS epidemic, but even more so in developing countries with high rates of AIDS infection and where complacency about AIDS has been the rule. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 46 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 AIDS/HIV Articles First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children March 29, 1993 First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children NIH has opened the first trial of experimental AIDS vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. First HIV Vaccine Trial will compare the safety of three AIDS experimental vaccines in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of AIDS disease. NIH Secretary Donna E. Shalala said First HIV Vaccine Trial can be seen as ""a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected children who now face the certainty HIV-infected children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS will develop AIDS."" Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said First HIV Vaccine Trial ""is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with AIDS who are not yet sick."" If three HIV experimental vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about three HIV experimental vaccines's therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in the United States have AIDS. By the end of the decade, the World Health Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. First HIV Vaccine Trial will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old. the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) anticipates conducting First HIV Vaccine Trial at nine ACTG sites around the United States and three sites participating in ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing AIDS-specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 47 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 stimulate new ones. It will be several years, however, before researchers know how existing HIV-specific immune responses affect the clinical course of AIDS. The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined closely for other reasons as well. ""First HIV Vaccine Trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate AIDS vaccines,"" said Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s division of AIDS. ""the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) need the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent AIDS infection in children."" In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire AIDS from Nearly all HIV-infected children's mothers during pregnancy or at birth. An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting AIDS to An infected mother in the United States's baby. As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to AIDS through injection drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children. AIDS disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults. The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with AIDS develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age. These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. At least half of the children in First HIV Vaccine Trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide must have well-documented AIDS infection but no symptoms of AIDS disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen. 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide's entry into First HIV Vaccine Trial. Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of Medicine, will coordinate First HIV Vaccine Trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s division of AIDS. ""We will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers, for example, than another,"" said James McNamara, M.D., medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. ""We'll also look at whether low or high doses of three HIV experimental vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects."" James McNamara, M.D., medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects among the three HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 48 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 products. First HIV Vaccine Trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant AIDS proteins. These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of AIDS, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in AIDS-infected adults. One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a protein that gives rise to AIDS's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant. Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine. Presently, alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration. Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major AIDS surface protein, gp120, plus adjuvant. The Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in Emeryville, Calif.--contain vaccine contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other Phase I vaccine trials in adults. A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children. Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn.,, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, considered the placebo. Neither the health care workers nor three children will be told what three children receive. If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., and adjuvant alone, considered the placebo in another group of 15 children will begin. Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 49 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 News from the National Institute of Dental Research There is new evidence that AIDS can cause disease independently of AIDS's ability to suppress the immune system, say scientists at the National Institues of Health. scientists at the National Institues of Health report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for AIDS. Although the AIDS genes were active in mice carrying the genes for HIV, the genes for HIV did not compromise mice carrying the genes for HIV's immunity, scientists at the National Institues of Health found. This led scientists at the National Institues of Health to conclude that AIDS caused scaling skin conditions. scientists at the National Institues of Health's findings support a growing body of evidence that AIDS can cause disease without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research. lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) and lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR)'s colleagues described Dr. Kopp and his colleagues's study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses. Developing animal models of AIDS infection has been difficult, since most animals, including mice, cannot be infected by AIDS. To bypass this problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for AIDS as well as their own genetic material. the National Institute of Dental Research scientists created HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material by injecting AIDS genes into mouse eggs and then implanting mouse eggs into female mice. The resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals. Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of AIDS genetic material in l988. mice that carried a complete copy of HIV genetic material in l988, however, became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth. In First HIV Vaccine Trial, scientists at the National Institues of Health used an incomplete copy of AIDS, which allowed 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide to live longer. Some of HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material developed scaling, wart-like tumors on Some of the transgenic animals's necks and backs. Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin lesions that covered most of Other transgenic mice's bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans. No skin lesions developed in Other transgenic mice's normal, non-transgenic littermates. Studies of tissue taken from scaling, wart-like tumors on their necks and backs showed that scaling, wart-like tumors on their necks and backs were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although AIDS can cause thickened, crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans, laboratory tests showed no sign of AIDS in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Tissue samples taken from 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide throughout First HIV Vaccine Trial revealed the presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the AIDS genetic material. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 50 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 Evidence of AIDS protein production proved that the genes for HIV were ""turned on,"" or active, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR). scientists at the National Institues of Health found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide: no increase in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide's white blood cell count and no signs of common infections. The fact that AIDS genes were active but 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide's immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus AIDS was causing thickened, crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans, lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) said. Further proof of AIDS gene involvement came from a test in which scientists at the National Institues of Health exposed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material to ultraviolet light. ultraviolet light increased AIDS genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin. Papilloma formation in response to increased AIDS genetic activity proved the genes for HIV were responsible for scaling skin conditions, scientists at the National Institues of Health said. No lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to ultraviolet light. The transgenic mice used in First HIV Vaccine Trial were developed at the National Institute of Dental Research by Dr. Peter Dickie, who is now with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Collaborating on First HIV Vaccine Trial with lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of the National Institute of Dental Research; Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, formerly with the National Institute of Dental Research and now with Burroughs Wellcome. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 51 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS March 4, 1993 NIH Secretary Donna E. Shalala today's announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV infection or AIDS. New NIH Research Program is staffed by a physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. New NIH Research Program provides information on drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods. New NIH Research Program is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of San Francisco General Hospital. HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said, ""One goal of New NIH Research Program is to share expertise so patients get the best care. A second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with AIDS or AIDS, which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with patients's medical providers and community social support networks. Currently, many providers refer patients with HIV infection or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience."" HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said, ""This clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV infection or AIDS in communities and clinical sites where AIDS expertise is not readily available."" The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and The telephone number for health care professionals is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) Monday through Friday. During these times, consultants will try to answer questions immediately, or within an hour. At other times, physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be answered as quickly as possible. Health care professionals may call New NIH Research Program to ask any question related to providing AIDS care, including the latest HIV infection or AIDS drug treatment information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, literature searches and other information. New NIH Research Program is designed for health care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials. When a health care professional the call New NIH Research Program, the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse practitioner. All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with AIDS-related diseases. The consultant asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current medications, sex, age and the patient's AIDS history. New NIH Research Program has grown out of a 16-month local effort that HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 52 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern California. The initial project was funded by HRSA's's Bureau of Health Professions, through HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions's Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and by the American Academy of Family Physicians. ""When providers expand providers's knowledge, providers also improve the quality of care providers are able to provide to providers's patients,"" said HRSA's Administrator Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H. ""New NIH Research Program will be a great resource for health care professionals and the HIV infection or AIDS patients health care professionals serve."" ""New NIH Research Program has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on AIDS care management,"" said HRSA's's associate administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H. ""Providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment methods and therapies for people with HIV infection or AIDS."" HRSA's is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within NIH.

We have reached our goal! A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week. Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received: John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier Again, thank you to all who gave! Judith Schrier have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review Wordscan Plus. Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems. Wordscan Plus runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett Packard Scanners. When initially bringing up Wordscan Plus, Wordscan Plus lets you select several options; (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. Judith Schrier like manual decomposition since Wordscan Plus then lets Judith Schrier select which parts of the document Judith Schrier would like scanned, and in what order. Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification. Wordscan Plus gives you two ""errors"" at this point. Blue which are words that were converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary. Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think Wordscan Plus converted correctly at all. I have found that Wordscan Plus should give Wordscan Plus more credit. Wordscan Plus is usually correct, instead of wrong. If a word is shaded blue, you can add a word to your personal dictionary. The only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words. I find about 200 words to be very limited, considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. After a document is converted, you can save a document in a multitude of word processor formats. Also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate TIFF or PCX file format. I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files. I use HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format. While most of my faxes were received in ""standard"" mode (200x100 dpi), the accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. Overall, a very impressive product. The only fault I could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary. 200 specialized words is just too small. If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR Emerging Infectious Diseases Introduction Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, salmonellosis, shigellosis, tuberculosis (TB), and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the U.S. public health system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, ""Emerging Infectious Diseases."" Future articles will address emerging infections, as well as surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). References 1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Preliminary report: foodborne outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections from hamburgers --western United States, 1993. MMWR 1993;42:85-6. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 4 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 Update: Multistate Outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 Infections from Hamburgers -- the western United States, From November 15, 1992, through February 28, 1993, more than 500 laboratory-confirmed infections with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and four associated deaths occurred in four states -- Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada. This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain. Washington On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January 18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants was initiated. As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the Washington Department of Health. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS (Figure 1). Of A total of 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients who recalled what the 338 patients who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 through January 20. Of 477 persons, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years (range: 0-74 years). Idaho Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December 11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were hospitalized; one developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). During the week preceding illness onset, 13 (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. Four of eight other persons with E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 5 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded Escherichia coli O157:H7, with onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea contact the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools for Escherichia coli O157:H7, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was not identified in any patient. After SMAC medium was distributed, the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7 was detected in the stool of one patient 38 days after illness onset. Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine were hospitalized; three developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The median age was 30.5 years (range: 0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients also implicated eating hamburgers at a chain A restaurant (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings During a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November 19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in ""jumbo"" patties produced on November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 lots of patties produced on those two dates; 11 lots of patties produced on those two dates had been distributed to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. A meat traceback by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team identified five slaughter plants in the United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 6 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.

Editorial Note: Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). Escherichia coli O157:H7 has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been implicated (3). Preliminary data from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2-year, nationwide, multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for Escherichia coli O157:H7 Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated more frequently than Shope RE in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a higher rate than for any other pathogen. Infection with Escherichia coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for Escherichia coli O157:H7 on HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 7 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite the magnitude of a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain, the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) for Escherichia coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). When infections with Escherichia coli O157:H7 are identified, infections with E. coli O157:H7 should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public health action to prevent further cases. Escherichia coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can contaminate meat during slaughter. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of raw meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices are clear. In a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 F (86.1 C) (The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), personal communication, 1993). Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in This report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before thousands of contaminated patties could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of Escherichia coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use smokeless tobacco frequently (1). To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This report summarizes findings from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter study. The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked ""Have you used snuff at least 20 times in your entire life?"" and ""Do you use snuff now?"" Similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use this difference higher among HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 10 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Editorial Note: The findings in This report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging Use of oral snuff among adolescent and young adult males and increasing adolescent and young adult males's risk for nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). In This report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in Seattle-based was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution. The actual exposure levels recorded in A new study published by the American Lung Association were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws. ""People with asthma have that inflammation, and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation,"" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was the lead author of A new study published by the American Lung Association. ""When people are on the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push people over the edge."" The Seattle-based Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less. PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less are considered hazardous because PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less are small enough penetrate into the lung. Cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air. In Seattle-based however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as 30 micrograms. The authors concluded that for every 30 microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent. The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, American Lung Association's medical section. A new study published by the American Lung Association is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat. A 1992 study by Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States. Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children. ""Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,"" says Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study. ""But more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well."" One problem in setting, standards for particulate air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study. Unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 29 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 acid aerosols. ""Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution,"" says Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study. ""We have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles. "" Consequently, most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research like the Seattle-based study. Given that the Environmental Protection Agency's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards, the Environmental Protection Agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any time soon. Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect people with asthma from airborne particles. ""In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but reports on air quality only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard's rarely particulate matter,"" says Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study. ""However, PM10 doesn't have to be near PM10's violation range to be unhealthy."" HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 30 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma brought together experts in dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi and dysplastic nevi's significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality. Following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared a consensus panel's consensus statement. Among a consensus panel's findings, a consensus panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma.

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 31 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers NCI-Designated Cancer Centers is comprised of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Within NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, there are four types of cancer centers: basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on clinical research; ""comprehensive"" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer prevention and control research. Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was the National Cancer Act of 1971 that The passage of the act the establishment of 15 new cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones. The passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971 also dramatically transformed 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality's structure and broadened the scope of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality's mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and cancer control research. Over the next two decades, 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality's program grew progressively. In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the United States. Today, there are 28 of 19 comprehensive cancer centers, all of which meet specific NCI criteria for comprehensive status. To attain recognition from NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an institution must pass rigorous peer review. Under guidelines newly established in 1990, the eight criteria for ""comprehensiveness"" include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice. Moreover, five of the eight criteria for ""comprehensiveness"" go significantly beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations. the eight criteria for ""comprehensiveness"" encompass strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of sources. The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 32 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 Of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, These centers are of the basic science type. These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory. Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into Clinical cancer centers's overall research programs. There are 12 such centers Today. Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research. consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from consortium cancer centers, of which there is one,'s research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs. Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. Together, 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move cancer research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Copyright 1993, Information, Inc., Bethesda, MD April 12, 1993 ""NIH Set to Test Multiple AIDS Vaccines"" Reuters (04/08/93) (Frank, Jacqueline) Washington--The Clinton administration will permit NIH to the therapeutic vaccine trials multiple AIDS vaccines instead of only allowing the Army to test a single vaccine, administration sources The decision Thursday. The decision ends the controversy between the Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. and NIH, which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last Friday. Companies including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and Immuno AG have already told NIH that Companies including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and Immuno AG are prepared to participate in the therapeutic vaccine trials. the therapeutic vaccine trials is intended to demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of HIV in patients already infected. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala refuted last week's reports that the Clinton administration had decided the Army's test of the MicroGeneSys Inc. VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time. ""The report was inaccurate, and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala expect there to be some announcement in the next 24 hours about that particular AIDS research project,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director Dr. Bernadine Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had convinced The Clinton administration that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously. But MicroGeneSys Inc. president Frank Volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of that particular AIDS research project and delay that particular AIDS research project by two years. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 41 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 ""The Limits of AZT's's Impact on HIV"" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. 114, No. 14, P. 18 AZT's has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since AZT's was approved by Food and Drug Administration in 1987. Burroughs Wellcome, the manufacturer of AZT's, made $338 million last year alone from sales of AZT's. However, a team of European researchers recently reported that although HIV-positive patients taking AZT's demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, a slightly lower risk of developing AIDS disappeared two years later. Lancet published preliminary findings of the three-year study, which could give more reason for critics to argue AZT's's cost, side effects, and general efficacy. Even though U.S. researchers concede the three-year study was more comprehensive than American trials, many argue a team of European researchers's suggestion that HIV-positive patients experience little improvement in HIV-positive patients's illness before the development of AIDS symptoms.

medical_65,"[reply to  (Jacquelin Aldridge)] Medicine is not a totally scientific endevour. The acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific. The application of scientific knowledge in individual cases may be more art than science. There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of many diseases now described.) After scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's's freedom of choice to try any experimental method the patient's choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn't have all the answers. Certainly we don't have all the answers. The question is, what is the most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge? The scientific method has proven The scientific method to be reliable. The *only* reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that alternative therapies's practitioners refuse to submit their practitioners's theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny, insisting that ""tradition"" or anecdotal evidence are sufficient. ""tradition"" or anecdotal evidence have been shown many times in the past to be very unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge. Crook's's ideas have never been backed up by scientific evidence. Crook's's unwillingness to do good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of Crook's's contentions. David Nye ().

Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski says that Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable responses of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's subjects during clinical trials. What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's research? Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski paints Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment, but (Josh Schwimmer) have no basis from which to judge Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's claims. Two weeks ago, however, (Josh Schwimmer) read that the NIH's Department of Alternative Medicine has decided to focus the NIH's Department of Alternative Medicine's attention on Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's work. the NIH's Department of Alternative Medicine's budget is so small that (Josh Schwimmer) imagine the NIH's Department of Alternative Medicine wouldn't investigate a treatment that didn't seem promising. Any opinions on Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current status of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's research would be appreciated. (Josh Schwimmer)  There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's's father to undertake Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's treatment for brain glioblastoma. brain glioblastoma is universally and usually rapidly fatal. After diagnosis in June 1992, brain glioblastoma was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy. a forum member's checked extensively on Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's track record for brain glioblastoma. a forum member's spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following his treatment for brain glioblastoma and to an NCI oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found other such case histories valid and impressive. After a forum member's's father began Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's treatment in September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosis. a forum member's's oncologist, although telling a forum member's a forum member's would probably not live past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to a forum member's's trying Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's treatment. Since brain glioblastoma stopped brain glioblastoma's rapid growth under Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's treatment, The patient's oncologist's since changed The patient's oncologist's attitude toward continuing these treatments, saying ""if brain glioblastoma ain't broke, don't fix brain glioblastoma."" Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, and administers a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients to patients with certain cancer types.

Steve'll give Steve some examples. 1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication. 2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid function for the purpose of quick weight loss. 3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by the NCI. These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should not committ but sometimes do. There are also errors of omission(some of which result in malpractice suits). Steve don't think that using anti-fungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of commission or omission. Healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering. Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures, others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that any reasonable treatment will help the patient. The key has to be tied to the healer's oath, ""I will do no harm"". But you know Steve that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient. The job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed. Each physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently. Some are very conservative while others are more agressive. An agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethical. What do I reserve the term quack for? Pseudo-medical professionals. Pseudo-medical professionals lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into Pseudo-medical professionals's lair. Some of Pseudo-medical professionals are really doing a pretty good job of providing ""alternative"" medicine. But many lack any formal training and are in the ""business"" simply to make a few fast bucks. While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative care area is really a buyer's beware arena. If you are lucky, you may find someone who can help you. If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of money and develop severe disease because of the inability of Pseudo-medical professionals to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the liscened physicians).

David Rind Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. There are people ahead of people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals's time, with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who. Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon. Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: people don't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease, people haven't developed something recognizable yet, or people have something that no one is going to recognize, because something that no one is going to recognize hasn't been described yet. Sometimes people get a cure, sometimes the disease wears out, sometimes people stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment, sometimes people find the disease's incurable. There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is more like ly that a person will find a cure if a person keep looking. -Jackie-",medical

Let Jon Noring put it another way to make Jon Noring's point clear: this word is a nebulous word lacking in any precision. this word's sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand. Funny, Jon Noring thought this word meant ""one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers"" (Dorland's 27th). Certainly more precision than conveyed by ""chronic yeast"". The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency; and coming from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real scary. The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous representations is far more frightening. It is fraud to promote a treatment where the evidence for a treatment is either lacking or against a treatment and the quacksalver knows so, or error if the honest practitioner doesn't know so. Failure to speak out against either bespeaks incompetency. (p.s., may Jon Noring suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and theories, such as the ""yeast theory"", should create your own moderated group. May Jon Noring reply - seriously - that if the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine have left the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine's minds so open that the parts of the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine's brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out, the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine should learn to edit the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine's newsgroup headers to conform to the existing hierarchy and divisions.

The cesarean rate in United States is the third highest among 21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 with previous years. Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean (VBAC) presented in This report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from NHDS to live births from national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of cesareans in This report will not agree with previously published data based solely on NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of 1.96. In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast (22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, essentially the same as the 23.5 observed. Based on NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of 966,000 (23.5%), an estimated 338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary cesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, 35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986; however, the findings in This report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in 1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and $4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges. Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted. To reach the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery, however, increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate. One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery (4).

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 4 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Malaria Among U.S. Embassy Personnel -- Kampala, Uganda, 1992 The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance. Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and U.S. citizens's dependents stationed overseas generally has been low, the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents stationed overseas varies substantially and unpredictably. During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of State (OMS/DOS), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala, Uganda indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala, the Office of Medical Services, Department of State (OMS/DOS), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted an investigation to confirm 27 cases of malaria and identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This report summarizes the results of an investigation. Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were available for review by the Office of Medical Services, Department of State (OMS/DOS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of 25 of the 27 reported case-patients, 17 were slide- confirmed as having malaria. A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala to obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for A questionnaire, 128 (82%) responded. Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in Kampala, Uganda. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala, Uganda for 1-5 years, compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the Kampala, Uganda area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria. Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in A questionnaire: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 9%) than among persons using Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 5 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening (0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening. As a result of an investigation, the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens. the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel. Reported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical Svcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Editorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings in This report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas. Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas (e.g., Thailand), resistance to Mefloquine may limit Mefloquine's effectiveness. In Africa, the efficacy of Mefloquine, compared with chloroquine, in preventing infection with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis (e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of Doxycycline (3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum has not been reported.

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 7 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 FDA Approval of Use of a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine and a Combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine for Infants and Children Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines have been recommended for use in infants since 1990, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines's routine use in infant vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib disease in United States (1-3). Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections. FDA recently licensed two new products for vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis: 1) the Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine (TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. ActHIB Trademark On March 30, 1993, FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB Trademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 8 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 for use in infants (4). In Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T, no cases of invasive Hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T These and other studies suggest that the efficacy of a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark On March 30, 1993, FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl River, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL Registered, manufactured by Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl River, New York) Pearl River, New York) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis Biologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when indications for vaccination with whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine, TETRAMUNE Trademark is expected to provide protection against Hib disease, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b vaccines. The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12- 15 months (5). The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 10 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Dental News International Workshop Explores Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection NIDR Research Digest written by Jody Dove March 1993 National Institute of Dental Research At Dental News International Workshop, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco, participants explored issues related to the epidemiology, basic molecular virology, mucosal immunology, and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection. the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of California, San Francisco. An international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance. the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as United States and Canada. Support tor the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco was provided by National Institute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, and the Procter and Gamble Company. Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and women's issues. Recommendations Recommendations emerged from the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. Epidemiology Since the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 radically changed. In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs. Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents. While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well. Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in Southeast Asia and more are appearing all the time. Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis. Researchers also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression and prognosis. Social/political Issues Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use. Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public about what AIDS is, and how AIDS is acquired. Saliva and Salivary Glands Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions. Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions. Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity. Research attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent virus reaching a target cell, and 2) direct effects on the virus or target cells. Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. Pediatric Issues Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest. With early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV- infected children has tripled. The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's sero-status is known prior to giving birth. Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 12 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection. Recommendations made at the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection, held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco include the standardization of terminology, refinement of diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. Occupational and Treatment Issues Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention. Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit of HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less. Proceedings from a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be published by the Quintessence Company in late 1993. --------- end of part 1 ------------ Internet:  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165 Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD FidoNet=1:114/15 Amateur Packet ax25: ",medical

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection. a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 is more than 99 percent effective. ""Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent pregnancy,"" said Food & Drug Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. ""As an injectable, given once every three months, Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose."" Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, a patient discontinues the injections. As with any such products, Food & Drug Administration advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 with patients's doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31. Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 effective as an injectable contraceptive. The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, dizziness, weakness or fatigue. Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 should not be used in women who have acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood clots in the legs, lungs or eyes. The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 14 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may this potential effect to osteoporosis. the manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect. Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., which will market Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection, first submitted Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 for approval in the United States in the 1970s. At the 1970s, animal studies raised questions about Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31's potential to cause breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 15 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses P92-37 Food & Drug Administration Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177 Food & Drug Administration today announced that Food & Drug Administration will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life- threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. ""New Rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible,"" said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. ""The effort to accelerate Food & Drug Administration review for drugs for patients with serious or life- threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease has been a long-term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration."" New Rules establish procedures for Food & Drug Administration to approve a drug based on ""surrogate endpoints"" or markers. New Rules apply when a drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. New Rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31's clinical effectiveness. One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the cause of AIDS. Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when Food & Drug Administration determines that a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan. ""New Rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous Food & Drug Administration oversight,"" said Food & Drug Administration commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. ""While drug approval will be accomplished faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law."" HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 16 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 The new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31's clinical benefit, if there is new evidence that Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive P92-31 is not shown to be safe and effective, or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of the drug or biologic. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 17 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Articles Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing Blindness due to Retinal Disease National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests Baltimore, MD - Researchers at the University of California San Francisco and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye is a major cause of visual impairment This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration's sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] and the National Eye Institute. This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at the University of California San Francisco, arld Dr. C;eorge Yancoooulos, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN]'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] holds an exclusive license for This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), from the University of California San Francisco. In the research described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS) , a light-damage model was used to assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor's photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor without causing unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. Discussing This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS),, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN]'s Director of Clinical Research, said, ""Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 18 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) could play a role in rescuing detached retinal cells once the retina has been reattached surgically."" ""Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life,"" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. In addition to This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] is developing Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN], Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] is testing Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] is a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and Steinberg of the University of California San Francisco are consultants to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN]. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 19 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease Research Resources Reporter written by Mary Weideman Nov/Dec 1992 National Institutes of Health High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly These findings risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat. These findings, according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries. ""This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well,"" explains principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. Over the past 25 years principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University and principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University's team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism. the Tara humara Indians in Mexico number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua. the Tara humara Indians in Mexico have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing. Probably as a result, coronary heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is virtually non existent in the Tara humara Indians in Mexico's culture. Loosely translated, the name Tarahumara means ""fleet of foot,"" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on ""kickball"" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball. The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables. the Tara humara Indians in Mexico also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs. the Tara humara Indians in Mexico's food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 percent) is of vegetable origin. Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator in This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS),, describes the Tara humara Indians in Mexico's diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat. the Tara humara Indians in Mexico have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl. All of those values are in the good, low-risk range, according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. Elevated cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 20 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 disease. HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial. In previous studies the Tara humara Indians in Mexico had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL- cholesterol. Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi. Food was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira's direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol. Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University laboratory for cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses. Regular measurements included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness. Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were fed Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent's native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an ""affluent"" diet. ""In This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), Dr. Connor and his team went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories. an ""affluent"" diet is the prototype of the holiday diet that many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in fiber,"" elaborates principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. ""the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet. the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol level, particularly the LDL,"" principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University explains. their native diet averages a very low CSI of 20; principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University's ""affluent"" diet used in This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), ranks a CSI of 149. The experimental design of This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of their native diet, before exposing subjects to their native diet. The standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat. Changes in dietary fat and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels. ""You must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into their native diet. The Framingham study, for example, did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat. the study participants were already eating on a plateau,"" principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University says. After 5 weeks of consuming an ""affluent"" diet, the study participants's mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL fraction, which rose 39 percent. HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little. Plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in weight. According to principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of an ""affluent"" diet as after 35 days. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 21 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations. ""We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic study. In the previous Tarahumara metabolic study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption. In This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), Dr. Connor and his team increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories. Dr. Connor and his team reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol. HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and HDL increased quite a bit in This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS),,"" principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University explains. Low HDL in the Tara humara Indians in Mexico is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because the Tara humara Indians in Mexico do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol. HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of Americans's usual high fat intake. principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs. Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat, high in fiber. principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adopt a ""Mediterranean-style"" diet. ""The original Mediterranean diet, in The original Mediterranean diet's pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products. We are already that pattern a lot of meat and dairy products. Simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation."" The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development. principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen. ""If the pattern of afluence increases, the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, which places a termendous health care burden on a society. The World Health Organization (WHO) would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so the developing countries can concentrate on other aspects of the developing countries's economic development and on public health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for unnecessary, expensive medical technology,"" principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University says. ""The overall implication of This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), is that humans can readily move humans's plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent, excessive diet. The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States was 20 years ago, so a lot has been accomplished. We are changing rapidly,"" principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University concludes.

But doctors who know of an HIV-positive colleague who has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate professional regulatory body. The guidelines also emphasize the significance of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an infected health-care worker. A model letter to patients who have come into contact with such an individual is provided, along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media. In addition, a U.K. advisory panel on HIV infection in health-care workers has been formed to provide specific occupational recommendations to those treating such patients. ""Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine'"" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 504 (Volvovitz, Franklin and Smith, Gale) The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by MicroGeneSys are advantages rather than disadvantages, write Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of MicroGeneSys Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that recombinant gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by MicroGeneSys does not stimulate the same antibodies as the HIV-1 virus does in natural infection. But vaccination with recombinant gp160 in patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1 specific envelope-directed immune responses, including crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T-cell responses. Volvovitz and Smith claim that Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of MicroGeneSys in Meriden, Conn. never intended Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of MicroGeneSys in Meriden, Conn.'s gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein. Antibody responses against native HIV-1 proteins, including the types described by Moore et al., exist in nearly all AIDS patients but do not prevent HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 42 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 progression of HIV disease. In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection. The absence of CD4 binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature. Phase I studies have demonstrated stable CD4 counts, stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune function. Based on these and other clinical results, recombinant gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by MicroGeneSys was chosen by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the first phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and Smith. ""HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 930 (Mok, Jacqueline) There are still more questions than answers regarding HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding HIV-1-positive women's babies, writes Jacqueline Mok of Lancet. The anti-infective properties of milk are well documented. While the numbers of leukocytes, concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then increase from three to twelve months, with 90 percent of total IgA in milk being secretory IgA. Breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, in both normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers. The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than bottlefed infants (9.7 months). Breastfed children also had a slower progression to AIDS. There is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against HIV-1 infection. Studies of the biological properties of milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women showed the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against envelope glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against core antigens. Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor. In the developing world, where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality, breast milk is still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status. Transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded. The possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok. ""Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to an Infected Dentist's Patients"" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269, No. 14, P. 1802 (Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.) If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M. Dickinson HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 43 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 et al. of the University of Miami School of Medicine in Miami, Fla. The researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and attempts were made to contact all patients treated by a dentist with AIDS for HIV testing. Living patients with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of Living patients with newly detected HIV infection's HIV to that of a dentist. Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail. There were 1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124 were deceased. An examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of whom were either homosexuals or IV-drug users. The researchers were able to detect 962 of the remaining 1,048 patients, and 900 agreed to be tested. HIV infection was reported in five of the 900 patients, including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for HIV-1. One patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior. Comparative DNA sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and five of the 900 patients, including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease were not closely related. The study suggests the potential for HIV transmission from a general dentist to a general dentist's patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson et al. April 22, 1993 ""AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says"" Washington Post (04/22/93), P. A13 TB can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. People who contract TB usually develop an immunity that protects People who contract TB if People who contract TB are exposed to TB again. But a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new TB infection, doctors found. Peter M. Small of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of a study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine, said that in order to protect against reinfection, it may be necessary for some people to use TB medicines permanently. a study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine examined the genetic makeup of TB bacteria and how TB bacteria changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County Hospital in New York. ""HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 930 (Mok, Jacqueline) There are still more questions than answers regarding HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding HIV-1-positive women's babies, writes Jacqueline Mok of Lancet. The anti-infective properties of milk are well documented. While the numbers of HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 44 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 leukocytes, concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then increase from three to twelve months, with 90 percent of total IgA in milk being secretory IgA. Breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, in both normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers.

""HIV and the Aetiology of AIDS"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 957 (Duesberg, Peter) Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the hypothesis that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically (AZT) and psychologically (positive AIDS test) toxic public health initiatives, writes Peter Duesberg of the University of California-- Berkeley. In Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Peter Duesberg of the University of California-- Berkeley's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and AZT lead to AIDS, ""a hindrance to public health initiatives."" However, Schechter et al.'s hypothesis that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not attained any public health benefits. The U.S. government spends $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, no prevention, and no AIDS control have resulted from work on the hypothesis that drug use leads to AIDS. Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4 depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against HIV and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from Vancouver. However, Schechter et al.'s survey neglects to disprove Peter Duesberg of the University of California-- Berkeley's drug- AIDS hypothesis, because their survey does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug- free AIDS cases--and because their survey does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT use altogether. To refute Peter Duesberg of the University of California-- Berkeley's hypothesis Schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to 10 years HIV-positive patients who use recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same AIDS risks as positives who do not do so. a period of up to 10 years is claimed by HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 45 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS. Alternatively, proponents of the HIV hypothesis could show that HIV-free individuals who have used drugs for 10 years never get AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Peter Duesberg of the University of California-- Berkeley. ""Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1 Infection"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959 (Vento, Sandro et al.) Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful ""autoimmune"" reactions, write Vento et al. of the A. Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy. Vento, Sandro et al. report three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with hepatitis C Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid, profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN. All three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum HIV p24 antigen and had circulating antibodies to p24. Sera from All three patients, obtained at the end of IFN treatment and testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II antigens, homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of HIV-1 gp41. These autoantibodies, which also recognize ""native"" class II molecules and may contribute to the elimination of CD4 T cells ""in vivo"", were at low tires (50-100) in All three patients six months after stopping IFN. Such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV infection and hepatitis C Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) related CAH treated with IFN and who did not experience CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful ""autoimmune"" reactions. All three patients had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell counts and clinical progression of HIV-1. IFN can induce a very rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these HLA haplotypes, The researchers conclude. April 23, 1993 ""TB Makes a Comeback"" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6 (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) Although TB was once believed to be eliminated in The U.S. government, TB is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS patients, immigrants, minorities, and prisoners. Dr. Lee B. Reichman, professor of medicine at the University of New Jersey Medical School and president of the American Lung Association, said, ""Right now, TB's a big city problem, but potentially TB's everyone's problem."" the American Lung Association predicts that 10 million Americans are infected with TB, and about 10 percent of 10 million Americans will develop TB because about 10 percent of them's immune systems are depressed, especially those with AIDS or HIV. Gene HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 46 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Tammes, a Centers for Disease Control expert, said that is why Centers for Disease Control has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS with TB patients. State health officials believe TB is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment. In addition, the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services. In New York, TB is an epidemic ""because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people,"" said Dr. George Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control. According to Dr. George Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control, curbing the spread of TB entails keeping 85 percent or more of diagnosed TB cases in treatment. About 40 percent of infected New York residents don't complete therapy. When TB patients don't finish taking TB patients's medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat. ""Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in Southern Florida: Artifact or Reality?"" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. 83, No. 4, P. 571 (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in Southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of risk, write Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga. Schechter et al. investigated 168 such AIDS cases from Broward and coastal Palm Beach counties. All of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of HIV transmission. Medical records of patients, in addition to records from social services, HIV counseling and testing centers, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics were reviewed. If no other HIV risk factor was found from medical record review, patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. Once STD clinic and other medical records were reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were the reclassification into other HIV transmission categories. After adjustments were made for the reclassification, the percentage of AIDS cases reported from Palm Beach and Broward counties between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men and from 33 percent to 28 percent among women. While the percentage of heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in Southern Florida decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases, the percentage of heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida still remained above the national average, The researchers conclude.

medical_92,"This is to followup Todd I. Stark's previous reply on this topic, which it has been pointed out to Todd I. Stark might have been dangerously misleading in two spots. 1. Todd I. Stark stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is misleading. psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) is not often found effective, particularly by psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on). Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy. The most current theories of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder attribute Obsessive Compulsive Disorder to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this distinction becomes important. 2. Todd I. Stark mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible diagnostic marker. However, 'impulses' might look like something people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. One of the diagnostic criteria of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is that the individual can and does suppress some of the individual's 'impulses,' although some of their 'impulses are an unending source of anxiety. The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part. Some references (one non-technical and several technical) that themself was kind enough to supply for Todd I. Stark but was unable to post themself : |""The boy who couldn't stop washing"" by judith rapaport. *** (technical refs) : | pharmacotherapy of o-c disorder | donna m jermain and lynn crismon | pharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-198 | epidemiology of ocd | seteven a rasmussen and jane eisen | j clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-13 | the waking nightmare: an overview of ocd | judith rapaport | j clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-28 | absence of placebo response in ocd | matig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olson | j nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. 4 And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive criticism to Todd I.

Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for My uncle's condition, or any condition? 2. What possible side effects are there. How can they be mimimized? Please respond via e-mail to  Thanks, Renee EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such use). There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this). There are side -effects to the use of EDTA(chelation therapy) because EDTA(chelation therapy) is not specific for calcium(it also binds other minerals). Renee think that there have been some deaths when EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected. In animal studies, the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement rabbits with vitamin C and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize magnesium(rabbits's own vitamin C, the extra vitamin C was given in magnesium(rabbits's diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from plaques in rabbits). The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form. Most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium. 1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review"" Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974). Supplementation with magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977). The need to measure the serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be overemphasized. This is a review article. 3.

medical_98,"In article <1rhfrkINN,  (Gordon Rubenfeld) writes:  writes: to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics? Gorden Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured  (Gordon Rubenfeld) that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and most physicians therefore reinnoculate most physicians's patients with *good* bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body.  (Gordon Rubenfeld) do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice. Nor is it  (Gordon Rubenfeld). What  (Gordon Rubenfeld) tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. Marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists. Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining ""good"" anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  (Gordon Rubenfeld) also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora). However, it is NOT part of  (Gordon Rubenfeld)'s routine practice to ""this practice"" patients with ""good"" bacteria after antibiotics.  (Gordon Rubenfeld) have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients. Whether or not this practice is a ""logical extension"" from the available observations  (Gordon Rubenfeld)'ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials. One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate the patients flora. Don't try this at home. not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams. Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Except that GI symptoms isn't. At least symptomatically apparent disease. Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way. There has always been the use of conventional wisdom. A very good example is kidney stones. Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming. Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once the stone formed. Through the recent New England J of Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake. Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical trial, like: AU Dismukes-W-E. Wade-J-S. Lee-J-Y. Dockery-B-K. Hain-J-D. TI A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments] SO N-Engl-J-Med. 1990 Dec 20. 323(25). P 1717-23. psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than 0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ] CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently, the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome appears to be unwarranted. Does A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome address every issue raised here, no. Jon Noring was not surprised at A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite Crook's recommendation for Nystatin). Maybe they didn't avoid those carbohydrates . . . The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans David? We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider yogurt dangerous). If this were a standard part of medical practice, as Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline. Marty, Marty've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (Jon Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms. There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials. Are we talking about ""real"" candida infections, the whole ""yeast connection"" hypothesis, the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc). We can't seem to focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.  (Gordon Rubenfeld)'m lost! Candida can do that to you. :-) David,  (Gordon Rubenfeld) think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it L. Acidophilus can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. Acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if the candida can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where the candida will have access to oxygen(just like the candida does in the vagina). As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L. Acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections,  (Gordon Rubenfeld)'m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out. The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window. Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very important one). The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely(like reinnoculation is in animal husbandry).

It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as ""desperate"", while the Liberal Democrats said the maternity pay plan was misdirected. the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said: ""Labour have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when Labour were elected, Labour have already taken maternity pay up to 26 weeks. ""Labour are going to extend Maternity pay for new mothers to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get Maternity pay for new mothers right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament."" the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take 12 months leave as only six of 12 months leave were paid. ""Labour have made a firm commitment. Labour will definitely extend Maternity pay for new mothers, from the six months where Maternity pay for new mothers now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400."" the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of fathers's partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: ""new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt were announced by Gordon Brown in Gordon Brown's pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt in Tony Blair's desperate bid to win back women voters."" The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said The Tories would announce The Tories's proposals closer to the General Election. the Liberal Democrats spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: ""While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel any extra maternity pay is being misdirected."" Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley's party would the move maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in the first six months. the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt also stressed new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers.

The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to ""compromise"". The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) said the potential ""step-change in participation and attainment"" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. ""Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA)'s view, compromise the integrity of the whole diploma,"" said The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA)'s chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA)'s concern that The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA)'s advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if a White Paper response were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. people may be content if a White Paper response does not ""close too many doors"" in writing - whatever spin is put on a White Paper response. The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. ""One of the reasons why The chief inspector of schools, David Bell,'m so strongly in favour of GCSEs and A-levels disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,"" The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, said. ""If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity."" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address A note of concern, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in ""functional"" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a ""massive upheaval"". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.",politics
politics_7,"Blair backs 'pre-election budget' Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims Blair was too bullish about the state of the UK economy. In a speech in Edinburgh, Blair said Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report reinforced stability and opportunity. And stability and opportunity would be central to Labour's's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Chancellor Gordon Brown's earlier denied Chancellor Gordon Brown's's economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. Chancellor Gordon Brown's told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""No politician should make the mistake that John Major and John Major's colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, No politician can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing. ""That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" Chancellor Gordon Brown's insisted Chancellor Gordon Brown's's spending plans were ""affordable"" and Chancellor Gordon Brown's could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Blair praised Blair's chancellor for Chancellor Gordon Brown's's role in creating economic stability, which Blair said was the ""cornerstone"" of Labour's's programme. In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, Blair said Labour's would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"". ""In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" Blair said. In Chancellor Gordon Brown's's pre-Budget report, Chancellor Gordon Brown's surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe between 3% and 3.5% is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: ""Chancellor Gordon Brown's thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. the Institute for Fiscal Studies're not so sure."" David Page, of Investec Securities, said: ""Chancellor Gordon Brown's's forecast that Chancellor Gordon Brown's will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic. ""It's going to take a significant turnaround in the UK economy to meet these targets."" Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: ""Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute for Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than Chancellor Gordon Brown's has got a black hole in Chancellor Gordon Brown's's finances. ""In order to deal with a black hole in his finances Chancellor Gordon Brown's will have to raise taxes after the next general election."" Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Chancellor Gordon Brown's of using ""fancy statistics"" to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Chancellor Gordon Brown's to open up Britain's books to the National Audit Office, to see if Chancellor Gordon Brown's had met Chancellor Gordon Brown's's ""golden rule"". ""It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, told MPs.",politics
politics_8,"Blunkett sorry over murder plan Blunkett has his ""gracious apology"" to MPs after the Home Office announced ""prematurely"" via press release a review of murder laws. Blunkett confirmed a review of murder laws was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as ""a mess"". Blunkett said a review of murder laws would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. the Home Office has already said a review of murder laws will begin next year. On Wednesday, a the Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for a review of murder laws had not been established but a review of murder laws was likely to include only England and Wales. News of a review of murder laws was released because it was thought Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the official announcement never came, with Blunkett saying a Commons debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. Blunkett said Blunkett had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed Blunkett's ""gracious apology"" and the review a review of murder laws. But Shadow home secretary David Davis argued Blunkett should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be ""dragged"" to face MPs. In Law Commission's report, Law Commission said Law Commission had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. Law Commission suggested different kinds of murders could be ""graded"" to recognise the seriousness of murder. But the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. Law Commission had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But Law Commission said Law Commission's proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the current murder law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was ""indefensible and should cease"". A key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. Law Commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of murders. But speaking after a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as ""a mess"" was published, the Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: ""Murder is the most serious of crimes and the Home Office have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. ""Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence."" Law Commission also recommended tightening the current murder law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.",politics
politics_9,"Tories attack burglar 'U-turns' Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars. The government has the decision out the law change the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. Tory leader Michael Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: ""It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to ministers's pledge to review the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence so only householders using ""grossly disproportionate"" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted Tony Blair to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. Tony Blair told MPs: ""If The government get the right response from only householders using ""grossly disproportionate"" force, The government will, of course, support a change in the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence."" Instead, The government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear people are entitled to defend people. On Thursday, Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Tony Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the law change and was now backtracking again. Tory leader Michael Howard said: ""The government've had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. ""It's not surprising Gordon Brown told Tory leader Michael Howard: 'There's nothing Tory leader Michael Howard could say to Gordon Brown now that Gordon Brown could ever believe.'"" Tory leader Michael Howard said the ""grossly disproportionate"" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as Norfolk farmer Tony Martin ran away from the farm. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke said Tory leader Michael Howard was wrong to say the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence was biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Norfolk farmer Tony Martin had said the rules were ""weighted overwhelmingly"" in favour of the householder, said Home Secretary Charles Clarke. Home Secretary Charles Clarke said: ""The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens was making and Tony Blair was making."" The new guidance would help ensure clarity on The issue, added Home Secretary Charles Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied a burglar up, beat a burglar and set a burglar alight, The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, said.

Finance Minister Sue Essex said an average funding increase of 6% was a ""good deal"" for local government. an average funding increase of 6% includes the ""full"" £7.4m from the UK Treasury the announcement by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. Finance Minister Sue Essex said where spending rises were kept to around 5% Finance Minister Sue Essex was ""confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels."" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that ""significant"" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. ""A limited amount of money has come available but A limited amount of money is not the answer to The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA)'s problems,"" said WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen,. ""It is vital that The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase."" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Finance Minister Sue Essex to lobby for increased funds. Finance Minister Sue Essex said: ""Finance Minister Sue Essex have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns local government and council tax payers have about council tax rises. ""Finance Minister Sue Essex have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and Finance Minister Sue Essex am aware of the pressures on a large number of local authorities to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties."" Finance Minister Sue Essex said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, ""even for those people who have moved up a band"". an average funding increase of 6% includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Finance Minister Sue Essex said: ""an average funding increase of 6% is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop the well-managed councils of Wales's services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage council leaders's budgets at a local level."" Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement ""hugely disappointing"". Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd said: ""Wales and Wales's local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the assembly government so often claims - it is anger."" ""This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both."" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly government, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly said: ""Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly know from Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly's discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders are doing Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders's utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebandingwill create a great deal of difficulty."" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for Chancellor Gordon Brown to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change ""is taking spin to the very verge of deception"". Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies added: ""Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.""",politics
politics_11,"Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party Kilroy has said Kilroy wants to ""change the face of British politics"" as Kilroy launched Kilroy's new party. Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party,said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration. Kilroy told a London news conference that 'Veritas' party would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". the UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman says UKIP leader Roger Knapman was glad to see the back of Kilroy. Kilroy promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said 'Veritas' party hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. Kilroy said 'Veritas' party would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. And Kilroy announced 'Veritas' party would be holding a leadership election. On Thursday Kilroy is due to announce which constituency Kilroy will run in at the forthcoming general election - that will come amid speculation Kilroy has Kilroy's sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat. Kilroy was joined in 'Veritas' party by one of the UK Independence Party's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now 'Veritas' party's deputy leader. the UK Independence Party's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said 'Veritas' party will just be a parody of the UK Independence Party. Kilroy announced Kilroy's decision to quit the UK Independence Party at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week. his decision to quit UKIP came after months of tension as Kilroy vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of the UK Independence Party. Kilroy said Kilroy was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had ""gone AWOL"" after the great opportunity offered by the UK Independence Party's third place at last June's European elections. ""While the UK Independence Party has turned the UK Independence Party's back on the British people, Kilroy shall not,"" Kilroy said. ""Kilroy will be standing at the forthcoming general election. Kilroy shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes Kilroy believe in. ""And, unlike the old parties, 'Veritas' party shall be honest, open and straight."" one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader also left the UK Independence Party saying Kilroy would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for the UK Independence Party called on one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader to quit London Assembly. the UK Independence Party asserts that one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. the UK Independence Party's leader, Roger Knapman, has said Its leader, Roger Knapman, is glad to see the back of Kilroy. ""Kilroy has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after last June's European elections it became clear that Kilroy was more interested in 'Veritas' party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing Kilroy, now 'goodbye',"" Its leader, Roger Knapman, said. the UK Independence Party officials also argue Kilroy has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party Kilroy once wanted to lead. This is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, the UK Independence Party should try to resolve the UK Independence Party's differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the British people a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further. Thank goodness that Kilroy has gone - now the UK Independence Party at least has a chance in the forthcoming general election! It is very sad to see the cause of our country regaining our country's proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within the UK Independence Party. Kilroy could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, the UK Independence Party achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy. It is a great shame a major advance has been dissipated in in-fighting. the UK Independence Party has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of Kilroy's own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting Kilroy join the English Democrats nor the New Party and take over the English Democrats nor the New Party's leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy. If Kilroy believes in truth and democracy then Kilroy and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on he and the two assembly members's own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another. So the UK Independence Party was good enough for Kilroy to lead, not good enough for Kilroy to follow! Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name! Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in our country. Kilroy could be on the verge of something huge if Kilroy can broaden Kilroy's appeal beyond this one issue. Kilroy is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy may just have courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and Robert's time may have come! Well if Robert cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up Robert's own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here Let's hope this is the start of both the UK Independence Party and Kilroy slipping into obscurity. Veritas? Veritas? will doom the UK Independence Party. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand Veritas? since all modern schoolchildren do still learn Latin in the classroom do all modern schoolchildren not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas? symbolises The whole essence of what RKS represents?",politics

politics_16,"Brown to outline presidency goals Next year will be ""make or break"" for development in poorer countries Brown will say as Brown sets out UK goals for UK's EU and G8 presidencies. Brown is due to outline a series of key targets UK will be judged on in the year. a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005 will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Brown also wants other G8 nations to match Brown's target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income. Brown also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. Brown is travelling to America next week as part of Brown's persuasion drive over the issue. Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries."" Brown's proposals were effectively a new ""Marshall Plan"" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability developing nations needed, Brown argued. EU's Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, Brown said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies. Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. ""That is why Next year is a test,"" Brown said.

Oxfam's Paying the Price report this week said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of the G8 of top industrialised nations's incomes on aid. But 34 years later none of the G8 of top industrialised nations had reached 0.7% of their incomes on aid and many had not yet set a timetable.

In an upbeat pre-Budget report, Brown slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. Brown also hailed the longest period of growth in UK ""industrial history"" but denied Brown was ""gloating"". But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Brown ""Sir Wastealot"". Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, said Brown's ""golden rule"" had ""turned to dross in Brown's hands"" and said Brown was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn. Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, told MPs: ""The tide is going out on Brown's credibility. Brown is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because Brown is not getting value for taxpayer's money."" Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Brown of ducking tough choices. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, said: ""Last week the prime minister gave the Liberal Democrats the politics of fear; this week Brown has offered the economics of complacency. ""There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt have not been confronted."" Brown rejected the Liberal Democrats's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists say Brown's forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. BBC economic editor Evan Davis said his forecasts on public finances were plausible but also a gamble. Brown's insistence Brown was not ""gloating"" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In Brown's speech, Brown set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election. a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. Brown also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007. And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while children's parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a ""welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in a ""welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history""'s history"", said Brown. Brown also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, Brown said Brown was providing an extra £1bn for local councils. an extra £1bn is expected to come from government departments such as health and education. Brown said Brown was set to meet Brown's two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt ""low and sustainable"" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March's's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but £31bn is still £2bn more than Brown predicted in Brown's March's budget. Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Brown forecast. Brown also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism. Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. But there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working.

Ban on hunting faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo expected most people would obey Ban on hunting - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting foxes. Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said police would challenge the ""one of two isolated hunts"" which are threatening to break Ban on hunting. But Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. ""The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. ""You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,"" Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance said. The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how police should deal with hunters who violate Ban on hunting. The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith said The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police ""in the near future"" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith has rejected a ""blanket policy"" of not enforcing Ban on hunting until the House of Lords has considered Ban on hunting's legality.

John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports said police had ""acknowledged police's duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences"". The Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to hunters. As well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to ""flush out"" foxes, as long as foxes shoot foxes's quarry rather than set the hounds on their quarry.

politics_22,"Straw attacked on China arms Moves to lift the European Union's's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives. the European Union's ban on arms exports to China was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an the European Union's arms code was more effective than the European Union's ban on arms exports to China. But Human Rights Watch says the European Union's is putting commerce above abuse concerns. In December, the European Union's pledged to work towards lifting the European Union's ban on arms exports to China but said the European Union's was not ready to do so yet. Germany and France have repeatedly called for the European Union's ban on arms exports to China to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious but Straw last week said Straw also wanted the European Union's ban on arms exports to China to end, despite US objections. Straw a prediction which has alarmed critics the European Union's ban on arms exports to China to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: ""This is a huge political signal from Europe that Europe are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square. ""There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for."" Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma. The scope of the European Union's ban on arms exports to China was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind The scope of the embargo, Straw told BBC Radio 4's World At One. In Britain, more export licences were refused under the existing the European Union's arms code than under the European Union's ban on arms exports to China, Straw said. And only two of the licences denied under the European Union's ban on arms exports to China would have been granted under the existing European Union arms code. ""the existing European Union arms code is much more effective, the existing European Union arms code's a more powerful tool of and Britain intend to strengthen the existing European Union arms code as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China,"" Straw said. Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the the European Union's arms exports code, Straw said. Human rights groups say the existing European Union arms code is not legally binding - but Straw said the existing European Union arms code would be given legal force by the laws of many the European Union's countries. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the decision would be ""profoundly wrong"". the decision could undermine Nato as the decision severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the European Union's ban on arms exports to China. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram argued: ""What Britain is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the European Union's ban on arms exports to China is lifted ""It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong.""

In an interview with the Independent, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens's officers would have to find other evidence before Guantanamo four could be tried in the UK. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens told the Independent: ""If an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game an admission could be used as evidence. ""The options are: if there is enough evidence Guantanamo four will be charged. If not Guantanamo four will be released as soon as possible."" Guantanamo four have been allowed to meet Guantanamo four's lawyers. Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said that after being ""tortured and abused"" at Guantanamo, Guantanamo four's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, told BBC News Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, remained very concerned about Guantanamo four's psychological state. Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg's, said Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, was shocked at the condition of Guantanamo four and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain Guantanamo four. Washington has claimed Guantanamo four were ""enemy combatants"" who trained at camps run by al-Qaeda. The Pentagon says Guantanamo four were freed after the UK promised Guantanamo four would not be a threat to the national security of Washington or any of Washington's allies. Guantanamo four were immediately arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 when Guantanamo four landed at RAF Northolt, west London, on Tuesday. Massoud Shadjareh, from the Muslim Safety Forum, said: ""What sort of homecoming is this? Guantanamo four are innocent people."" The Muslim Council of Britain urged that Guantanamo four should receive counselling and medical help. ""The Muslim Council of Britain want Guantanamo four to be returned into the arms of Guantanamo four's waiting family,"" said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of The Muslim Council of Britain.",politics
politics_30,"Clarke to unveil immigration plan New controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on Monday. Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. Tony Blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no ""magic bullet"". The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say government plans unveiled on Monday may not produce an efficient system. The government's's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if Labour wins the election, expected to be held in May. Ministers deny Ministers have been spurred into action by The Tories campaigning or because Tony Blair is worried too little has been done. Instead, Ministers say government plans unveiled on Monday are part of an ""evolving"" process aimed at winning public confidence. Clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants' families, and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants. Tony Blair on Sunday said immigration would be ""toughened up"" to ensure only those immigrants with skills the UK really needs will be granted work permits. But Tony Blair rejected The Tories's call for a quota on economic migrants, saying no ""arbitrary figure"" could reflect the UK's needs. Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""We should cut the number or increase the number depending on the UK's needs ""The public are worried about this, The public are worried rightly, because there are abuses of the system."" But Tony Blair defended the UK's current regime, saying all systems around the world were subject to abuse. The Tories proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Tony Blair. Tony Blair said: ""We will not be pretending there is some simple easy way of processing the UK's asylum seekers in some other country, because no such other country exists."" Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said The government's had failed to remove 250,000 failed asylum seekers from the UK and limits on economic migrants had been a ""shambles"". ""What we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from The government's after eight years of failure,"" Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said Labour was right to reject The Tories's idea of quotas on asylum. But Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said it was yet to be seen if Clarke could deliver ""a fair and efficient asylum system"".",politics

On Tuesday, Mayor said Mayor would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly. Two motions were passed by the London Assembly, which is made up of 25 members elected to examine Mayor's activities, on Monday asking Mayor to apologise and withdraw Mayor's comments. Mayor said Mayor had recounted to the assembly a number of ""examples of intrusion by journalists"" into Mayor, and Mayor's family's private life.

A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws quit when the government's failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful. A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign. A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws told BBC News: ""The reason why A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws am his resignation is because A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. ""the current system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. ""A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws think the current system is giving Britain a bad name internationally"". Under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government's in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. But A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. ""A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws's own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. ""As far as A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws'm concerned, the government's have to start all over again and rethink the government's's whole strategy for dealing with this."" A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws added. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws on Monday. According to the Independent, A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws's resignation is expected to be followed by those of Five more barristers. Five more barristers are all believed to be carefully considering Five more barristers's positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws said A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws had ""no idea"" whether further resignations would follow. But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4's Today programme that more lawyers may go. ""Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning,"" Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty said. ""more lawyers are now in a situation where everything more lawyers have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of more lawyers sleepless nights."" Helena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the Special Advocates' main concern was that once the Special Advocates had seen any special intelligence the Special Advocates were not allowed to speak to the detainees. ""When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review,"" Helena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer said. ""Without a process that could be considered a judicial review you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.""",politics
politics_34,"MPs''s murder sentence concern Murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new MPs' report. The influential Commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. MPs' also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. MPs' say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. Committee chairman John Denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse. ""The influential Commons home affairs committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under sentencers's influence should instead be an aggravating factor."" At present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term judges must serve - if murderers pleads guilty. But although murderers are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. In July this year Amanda Champion's's killer, James Ford, his plea guilty to Amanda Champion's's murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had Amanda Champion's killer, James Ford denied the charge. Amanda Champion's's uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Amanda Champion's killer, James Ford did not deserve any credit for Amanda Champion's killer, James Ford's plea, saying: ""Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence."" MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty. last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty passed into law virtually unnoticed after Home Secretary David Blunkett introduced last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill. As a result, says The influential Commons home affairs committee, the government may need to re-legislate to ""remove ambiguity"" over how murderers should be sentenced. The influential Commons home affairs committee is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. The influential Commons home affairs committee said draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty had not reflected the ""public disquiet"" expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf,'s Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. As a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if murderers who face a 15-year tariff give murderers who face a 15-year tariff up to the police. Committee chairman John Denham believes Lord Woolf's Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) should reconsider Lord Woolf's Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC)'s proposals to reflect Parliament's's wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. Committee chairman John Denham said: ""Parliament's want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances."" But a spokesman for the Home Office defended its proposals. a spokesman for the Home Office said: ""By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament's sent a clear signal that Parliament's expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. ""the Home Office stand by the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial."" Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Home Secretary David Blunkett introduced its proposals. ""There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime,"" Shadow home secretary David Davis said. But Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten warned The influential Commons home affairs committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference. ""The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, every murder is also different,"" Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten told BBC News.",politics

Diversity ""certainly must not mean segregated or separate"", Ofsted chief, David Bell, said. Ofsted chief, David Bell,'s speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.

Ministers have been accused of panic in the offer last minute changes to a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" amid chaotic scenes in the Commons on Tuesday. Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. Falconer said last minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear. a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on people's behalf if people become too ill to decide for people. Ministers insist last minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. Critics fear last minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill could allow ""killing by omission"" through withdrawing treatment, including food and fluids. Tony Blair said Tony Blair would do everything Tony Blair could to meet concerns about a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"". But changes to a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from Hillsborough coma victim Tony Bland. ""It is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay doctors and consultants open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen,"" Falconer said. On Tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs. rebellion by 34 Labour MPs was also reduced by news that Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"". But news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill only came after MPs bombarded Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy with a barrage of requests for Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy to read the letter as MPs complained MPs had been left in the dark. Eventually, Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes, prompting claims of a shambles. Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy later said the debate had not been handled as the debate should have been. Falconer says there will be amendments when a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" goes to the Commons. Falconer told BBC News: ""We have given a commitment to put into a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" a clause that says that nothing in a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life. ""The motive has got to be to end suffering."" Falconer denied the concessions were a ""political manoeuvre"" forced by panic about rebellion by 34 Labour MPs. It was inevitable that minds became more focused as a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia ""through the back door"" went through Parliament but the result was a ""sensible solution"", Falconer said. ""Falconer don't think it is something to be embarrassed about. These issues are not easy to deal with,"" Falconer went on. BBC political editor Andrew Marr said Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy was ""waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast"" after Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy's performance. But Lord Falconer praised Lord Falconer's minister for an ""excellent job"".

politics_39,"Anti-terror plan faces first test Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial's first real test in Parliament. Tories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are poised to vote against Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial. Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. Opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of UK citizens. The government is expected to win Wednesday's's vote in the Commons, but faces a battle in the House of Lords. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill was published on Tuesday. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill proposes ""control orders"", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects. Tories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are particularly worried that ""control orders"", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge. Tory shadow home secretary David Davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the Guildford Four - for which Tony Blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. ""the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects would be much more for a politician than the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach,"" Tory shadow home secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Home Secretary Charles Clarke says Home Secretary Charles Clarke does not intend to use the powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. Home Secretary Charles Clarke also said that any decision Home Secretary Charles Clarke made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the 11 current terror detainees are mostly held at London's Belmarsh prison. the 11 current terror detainees are held under laws which the House of Lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 March. The new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the House of Lords's concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects. Critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive UK citizens of UK citizens's freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. Opposition MPs are also angry Opposition MPs will have only two days - Wednesday's and next Monday - to debate Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial before Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial pass to the House of Lords. But The government says the powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently. In a rare move, the Tory and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing The Prevention of Terrorism Bill, saying Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are ""excessive"". a motion opposing the new bill argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and The Prevention of Terrorism Bill ""wrongly infringes the right to liberty"" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. Tory shadow home secretary David Davis told Today: ""It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned."" Tory shadow home secretary David Davis questioned why there was ""such a rush"" to introduce The Prevention of Terrorism Bill when Home Secretary Charles Clarke had indicated Home Secretary Charles Clarke was not planning to use the powers straight away. Lib Dems home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""Lib Dems believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians."" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said the security services and police backed Home Secretary Charles Clarke's measures and it would be ""rash and negligent"" to ignore the security services and police's advice.

Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was ""fractured, divided and uncertain"", Blair said. a world that was ""fractured, divided and uncertain"" had to be brought together, Blair added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism. But there was a need to recognise global terrorism would not be defeated by ""military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values"" Blair added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's's single most ""pressing political challenge"" of the present day, Blair warned. Blair also urged Europe and the US to ""build anew Europe and the US's alliance"". ""All of us in positions of leadership, not Bush, have a responsibility to rise to the conflict in the Middle East. It is urgent that All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush do so."" Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's's campaign, saying Democrat John Kerry's had helped make the presidential election ""a true celebration of American democracy"". Mr Bush's re-election was significant for the world's but particularly so for Britain because of Britain's special relationship, Blair added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Bush Tory leader Michael Howard's ""warmest congratulations"", saying: ""Britain look to Bush to be a unifying force for those all over the world's who share Britain's determination to defend freedom."" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the presidential election, unlike in 2000. Bush's first task was to ""rebuild a sense of domestic purpose"" within the US, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said: ""Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism."" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Democrat John Kerry's would have given Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an ""umbilical cord"" between Bush and Democrat John Kerry's. ""Europeans must hope that Bush's administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that Bush will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. ""Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come."" Even before the result became clear, Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at Blair's first meeting with whichever candidate won. Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions.

Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay were detained in Guantanamo as part of the US-led ""war on terror"". Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the US had agreed to the return of the detainees All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay after ""intensive and complex discussions"" over security. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK had been negotiating the return of All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay since 2003. All four families have been informed of All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay's return and have been involved in regular discussions with the UK, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said. But Foreign Secretary Jack Straw added: ""Once All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity."" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay. But The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, said there were still ""serious questions"" both over the possible threat All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay pose to the UK, and the treatment All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay had been rescued from a ""legal no-man's land"". ""All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay's civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay were denied due process.""

Azmat Begg, father of Moazzam, added: ""If All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay have done something wrong, of course All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay should be punished, but if All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay haven't, All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay shouldn't have been there."" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Feroz Abbasi and Martin Mubanga, said the UK should have acted sooner. Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said: ""the UK should at the outset have said quite clearly to the US that All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay were behaving in breach of international law and that the UK wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo shut down. ""the UK didn't do that. the UK colluded with it."" Martin Mubanga's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed Martin Mubanga's release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Martin Mubanga and the other detainees could bring against the US, Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff said: ""People get released from prison when it's found that People's prosecution was unsustainable and People are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. ""Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff don't see any difference in this case."" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Guantanamo a ""major human-rights scandal"" and an ""icon of lawlessness"". Both Amnesty International and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the return of the detainees as ""long overdue"". Civil rights group Liberty said Civil rights group Liberty was ""delighted"" but called on the UK to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial. Director Shami Chakrabarti called on the UK to ""practise what the UK preaches"" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons were being held in contravention of human rights laws but 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons are still behind bars. the US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Guantanamo.

politics_43,"Tories attack EU asylum moves David Blunkett has been accused of using the ""politics of confusion"" to disguise new EU immigration measures. Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing the UK's power of veto over who was allowed to come to the UK. EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. David Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration the UK did not agree with. David Blunkett argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK. ""If the UK don't like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality the UK have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people,"" David Blunkett said. David Blunkett was responding to an emergency question from David Blunkett's Tory opposite number Mr Davis. ""The government is employing the ""politics of confusion"" - his Tory opposite number Mr Davis think, deliberately,"" argued his Tory opposite number Mr Davis. ""By confusing the UK The government hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto."" On Monday Tony Blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of British borders. Tony Blair said an enlarged 25-member EU needs a streamlined decision making process. his Tory opposite number Mr Davis said once the UK had opted into policies then the UK could not opt out - leaving the UK open to unfavourable interpretations of what policies actually meant. his Tory opposite number Mr Davis accused The government of being ""pathetic"" when it came to The government's efforts over immigration and asylum and of ""surrendering"" on immigration and asylum. And his Tory opposite number Mr Davis asked why The government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when immigration and asylum was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over. Tony Blair told Tony Blair's monthly news conference the UK had the ""best of both worlds"" and would keep the asylum and immigration veto. ""There is no question of the UK giving up the UK's veto on the UK's border controls,"" Tony Blair said. ""With the Treaty of Amsterdam seven years ago, the UK secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that the UK wanted to in Europe."" David Blunkett met David Blunkett's EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on immigration and asylum. The 25 member-states are expected to the change the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy, in favour of the qualified majority voting (QMV) system. Under the qualified majority voting (QMV) system larger states such as the UK are expected to have more power than the smaller EU states. the UK is expected to retain an ""opt-in"" right which will allow the UK to ignore any measures the UK disagrees with. Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten called the change pragmatic and argued the change gave a better chance of producing a European asylum solution. ""If we don't work together it means some countries can ignore some countries's responsibilities at the expense of some countries's neighbours,"" said Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten. ""Liberal Democrat have long argued that the UK should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it's right that we don't do this in isolation.""",politics

politics_45,"Correction agency plans dropped Plans to create a single correctional agency for Scotland have been scrapped. The Scottish Executive will not now merge the Scottish Prison Service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. The National Correctional Agency would have provided a 'one-stop' justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. Instead, Scottish councils and the Scottish Prison Service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. The plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison, preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending. Scotland's reoffending rate is high, with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. This is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and The Scottish Executive wants to tackle the problem. Ministers thought the idea the Scottish Prison Service with local authority social work criminal justice departments, might have provided an answer. However, following a consultation on the idea, Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson has decided to drop Plans to create a single correctional agency for Scotland. Instead, Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson will the move the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system. Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson will announce the move in Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson's Criminal Justice Plan on Monday, aiming to ""break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community"". The new measures will place a new statutory duty on the Scottish Prison Service to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. A national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson on the Scottish Prison Service's role and performance in reducing reoffending. Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson said: ""Better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought offenders there. ""Communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better. ""It costs the taxpayer £35,000 a year to provide each prison place and £35,000 a year is increasing. ""Taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping Taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime in prison. ""Therefore, as we continue to invest in the Scottish Prison Service, it is only right that we seek to ensure that the Scottish Prison Service becomes more accountable to the public the Scottish Prison Service serves, to ministers and to parliament.""",politics

A range of services in Wales were affected as civil servants in Wales joined the UK-wide strike.

Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham.

Top judge said Top judge was determined Top judge's current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence. But Top judge told MPs the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, was insisting the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, should have the final say in such cases. Lord Hutton's's inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries. The government says the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, would be unlikely to go against Top judge's wishes. Top judge was giving evidence to the Commons public administration select committee's's inquiry into public inquiries. Top judge said Top judge had not been involved in the choice of Lord Hutton, who as a law lord did not come under Lord Hutton's's jurisdiction. But Top judge argued Top judge should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so, which judge a particular inquiry should be. In written evidence to the Commons public administration select committee's, Top judge said: ""Top judge have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, on this issue  Top judge intend to maintain Top judge's position and will press for his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry to be in any future legislation."" Judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue, such as the intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Top judge said. Top judge argued: ""The subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved. ""In addition, the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed, the judiciary, as a result of the appointment, may be seen as siding inappropriately with The government."" Top judge told MPs: ""Anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries Top judge."" Top judge said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, would overrule Top judge's concerns. But that situation could change with new legal reforms. the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all had been ""overlooked"" when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions. ""What Top judge am asking for is a situation where if the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, cannot obtain Top judge's agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn't happen,"" Top judge said. Top judge said Top judge did not think there would be difficulties but Top judge wanted to establish the principle.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""Whilst it is good that Labour has rejected the the Tories idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the Home Office's ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system."" Clarke has said the UK should take the UK's fair share of the world's ""genuine refugees"". But Clarke claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with the current asylum system the UK's generosity. Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, called on Clarke to denounce the suggestion the UK's hospitality was being tested by immigration. ""Tell that to the 44,000 doctors in the NHS and the 70,000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the NHS means,"" Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality said. ""Ditto the teachers, from South Africa, Australia's, Jamaica, who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools."" the Commission for Racial Equality said Clarke's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.",politics

House of Lords law lords a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws against terror detentions last week. House of Lords law lords said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for British suspects. Clarke said Clarke would carefully consider a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws and would return to Parliament early in the new year with proposals. Clarke insisted that Clarke would not be rushed into judgement but would examine House of Lords law lords's findings in detail. ""Clarke's duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are."" Clarke's comments came in response to an emergency question from Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman David Heath. Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman David Heath said a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws contained ""unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal"". Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman David Heath said Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman David Heath accepted the difficult balance between this country's security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made ""no contingency plans for the present circumstances"". ""foreign terror suspects should be prosecuted and tried. Simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option."" Shadow home secretary David Davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws and urged the government to move as fast as ""competently possible"" to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice. ""If the government do, the government will give the government every support."" House of Lords law lords's ruling came on Clarke's first day as home secretary last Thursday following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement on last Thursday, Clarke said: ""Clarke will be asking Parliament to renew the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation in the new year. ""In the meantime, we will be studying a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by House of Lords."" But the government was widely criticised for insisting terror detentions would continue following the ruling last week. Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as the rules allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead's ruling, said: ""Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law."" foreign terror suspects took foreign terror suspects's case to House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the home office's powers to hold foreign terror suspects without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US.",politics

Meanwhile, Gordon Brown is leaving Britain on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight poverty issues. But before doing so, Gordon Brown insisted Gordon Brown still trusted Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book. Labour MPs have warned against disunity and Tory leader Michael Howard may well take up disunity in the Commons. The Tories have already accused Blair and Blair's chancellor of behaving like ""schoolboys squabbling in a playground"". Tory leader Michael Howard is likely to want to capitalise further on feud talk when Tory leader Michael Howard goes head-to-head with Blair in the Commons. At a campaign poster launch on Tuesday, Gordon Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of Gordon Brown. Later this week Blair is due to set out the themes of Blair's party's next election manifesto, which for the past two polls have been drawn up by Gordon Brown. Gordon Brown, meanwhile, is visiting Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya to highlight the plight of many Africans hit by Aids, war and famine - issues which Blair has also spoken out on. The prime minister and Gordon Brown faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's's new book. Blair told MPs and peers: ""Blair know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.""

There was an outcry three months ago when the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Woolf - published the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf -'s proposals for England and Wales. the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf - had suggested judges should the one third reduction sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. But the one third reduction has now been the move to one-sixth, with no reduction for those killers given a ""whole life tariff"". At the time Woolf, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave people up before people's crime had even been detected. its proposals for England and Wales were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, Woolf said. But director of the Victims of Crime Trust, Norman Brennan, accused Woolf of having an ""arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public"". The National Association of Probation Officers said the move would be ""political suicide"". In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf -, the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be ""weighed carefully"" by a judge so possible reductions did not lead to ""an inappropriately short sentence"". Where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, the section on murder said. In a statement issued on Wednesday Woolf said: ""Woolf have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf - has vastly improved its proposals for England and Wales.

Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, who sits on the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf -, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. ""What the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.

Once six leading lobbies've got the candidates in the 659 constituencies's responses six leading lobbies will publish the results within the 659 constituencies and nationally as well.

That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment. six leading lobbies haven't worked out specific plans but Adair Turner's imagine six leading lobbies will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs. Various local groups will do that in Various local groups's particular areas and six leading lobbies will provide a national briefing. six leading lobbies don't have any large demonstrations planned but any large demonstrations can't be ruled out. It is hard to say whether six leading lobbies will be successful. six leading lobbies have got Pensions in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise an election's importance in the public mind or whether an election will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq. Repealing the Hunting Bill. six leading lobbies are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action. six leading lobbies are hoping to hear in the New Year. Whichever way High Court rules the other side will appeal so six leading lobbies expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. When the ban comes into force on 18 February six leading lobbies will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid. So there's a lot of legal territory to go. six leading lobbies are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. Whatever intelligence six leading lobbies get six leading lobbies will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (Rural affairs minister) Alun Michael has avoided six leading lobbies and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. It is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything. It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face. It's exactly what Tony Blair did not want. Tony Blair wanted Pensions off the table until after the election. People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. trophy hunting is another sort of form of shooting for sport. The principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant. six leading lobbies will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. six leading lobbies will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the country. six leading lobbies will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that individual MPs and would-be MPs are against the use of animals as targets for sports. six leading lobbies would like the support of political parties but Adair Turner's think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to MPs's electors. With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say many MPs who were happy to say they were against it were against hunting. Adair Turner's think what six leading lobbies will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. Whether or not we will get a ban Adair Turner's am not sure. But a ban will mobilise public opinion. Everything six leading lobbies do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban. The issue that six leading lobbies think is the most important for the election is choice. The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. Choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. Choice as an ideology's become an issue in Choice as an ideology but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in Choice as an ideology. Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate choice on the consumer's terms. Firstly, six leading lobbies have six leading lobbies's website. our website features six leading lobbies's campaigns and changes every day. Secondly through six leading lobbies's 700,000 members who communicate with six leading lobbies. Thirdly through the media and also what six leading lobbies will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. six leading lobbies will invite the opinion formers, MPs, journalists and others. The idea is that six leading lobbies open up communications between members of the public and the politicians. Adair Turner's think six leading lobbies will be successful. It's very much the language being used by the main political parties. Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to Pensions Politicians on all sides want to be seen to be responding to Pensions. Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. We have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that Gordon Brown has been postponing and postponing. Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle Tuppence's an increase of about £750. If you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that. If fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and Adair Turner's would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. What a huge effect will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business. six leading lobbies will continue to do what six leading lobbies have always done six leading lobbies keep Pensions in the trade press. Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the trade press. Whatever six leading lobbies do, the public don't like lorries - the public see six leading lobbies as a complaining minority. But the public don't realise that when you see a car on the road a car is probably going to work, when you see a lorry a lorry's already at work.",politics

Howard asked: ""How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?"" That question was later unveiled as the headline for new Tory campaign posters. But Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people's priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour. ""Blair can stick up whatever Blair likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages, low inflation, low unemployment that Labour delivered and that Blair failed to,"" Blair said. Blair is currently on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans. But before doing so, Blair insisted Blair still trusted Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book. Brown's Britain, by Robert Peston, says there is mutual animosity between the two men. a new book claims Blair his pledge in November 2003 Blair would stand down as prime minister before the next election. But Blair went back on Blair's pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Gordon Brown was manoeuvring against Blair, a new book says. Robert Peston's book claimed that Gordon Brown that quote Blair: ""There is nothing Blair could ever say to Gordon Brown now that Gordon Brown could ever believe."" Blair directly denied that quote on Wednesday. Blair again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not Blair had offered to quit. The Tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with Blair. Blair declared: ""Blair is the deals on meals prime minister. No wonder Blair is not a happy eater."" Blair continued: ""How can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government, how can they clean up our hospitals when they don't clean up their act?"" Blair said Blair would not respond to ""tittle tattle in books"" and promised to hail Labour's record on the economy, waiting lists and law and order ""from now until polling day"". Later at their poster launch Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said Tory co-chairman Liam Fox's party would exploit opportunities to show how ""juvenile"" the prime minister and Blair were. Labour staged a show of unity at Labour's own poster launch on Tuesday, where Gordon Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of Blair. But Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy told BBC News: ""The government is clearly split at the top. This kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody.""

Announcing Plans to abolish 162 quangos, Tory frontbencher John Redwood said: ""Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges Mr Blair made. ""Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" Tory frontbencher John Redwood's party leader, Michael Howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending.

But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng attacked the Tories plans. ""Tories are committed to cutting Labour's public spending plans by this scale,"" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng said.

The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of Tory leader's MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Tory leader said that these things happened in politics and these things would not affect the outcome of the election.

The bulk of £35bn in government spending will go back into frontline services, Tory leader said. The £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, Tory leader added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the ""unfair taxes"". ""Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,"" Tory leader insisted. ""Because borrowing is going up, borrowing is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both.

Savings of £153m at the Foreign Office and £336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified.

politics_75,"Kennedy looks to election gains the Liberal Democrats may not know quite how to describe the Liberal Democrats's position in British politics - the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition. But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is the Liberal Democrats, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour. As the Tories leader Michael Howard kicked off Tory leader Michael Howard's election campaign, the the Liberal Democrats leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Tories as a ""fading"" force. And Kennedy insisted there was ""no limit"" to Kennedy's party's ambitions in the coming poll. And Kennedy can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up Kennedy's optimism for an election which Kennedy believes might just see Kennedy's party doing big things. Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how Sensible third party leaders will do come the big test. And Kennedy was not falling into that trap when Kennedy fired up Kennedy's campaign from the Liberal Democrats's Westminster HQ. Kennedy would make no predictions other than that Kennedy expected the Liberal Democrats to increase both the Liberal Democrats's votes and the Liberal Democrats's Commons seats at the coming poll. The gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, Kennedy claimed, by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson - that only Kennedy's party offered a genuine alternative. On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between Labour and the Tories whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives. Kennedy was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. Kennedy was also happy to offer a pledge that Kennedy would be doing no deals to ""prop up"" either of the other big parties after the coming poll. There was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the Liberal Democrats. the other big parties will still insist that the Liberal Democrats are no hopers whose greatest effect on the coming poll will be to boost the hopes of the other big parties's opponents by denying their opponents otherwise winnable seats. Labour, in particular, fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the Liberal Democrats allowing the Tories to win some seats. But Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. Kennedy will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who believe the coming poll could well be the election that sees Kennedy's party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power. the Liberal Democrats will hope to have made advances because of the Liberal Democrats's consistent stand against the war on Iraq. But Kennedy believes Kennedy's new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin Kennedy's claim that Kennedy's party really is the only opposition worth the name.",politics

Blair said: ""Tory spending plans would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services. ""Blair believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,"" Blair said. ""Tory spending plans's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were Tory's hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government."" Blair added: ""Tory have learned nothing."" By contrast, Blair said, Labour Party had listened to Labour Party's electorate and changed.

""Everybody knows, having lived through his government's the last seven years, that his government's faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,"" David Davis said.

politics_80,"Lib Dems' 'bold' election policy Charles Kennedy has told voters Charles Kennedy's Liberal Democrats will offer voters an ""honest choice"" at the next general election. With the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, Charles Kennedy is going into the next general election pledged to increase taxation. Lib Dems' 'bold' election policy is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between Lib Dems' and the other two. With Charles Kennedy's party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, Charles Kennedy has switched tack. Now Charles Kennedy is promising to levy a ""modest"" increase of the same amount on earnings over £100,000 a year to allow Charles Kennedy to finance a series of pledges. a series of pledges are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. a local income tax will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others, pensioners in particular, will pay less. Labour and the Tories have attacked Charles Kennedy's policies as both unworkable and not properly costed. Inevitably Labour and the Tories insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. the Tories claim the Tories can improve services AND cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings, while Labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance Labour and the Tories will propose increases. In many ways the argument between Lib Dems' and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between Labour and the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. But, unlike the old the Tories-Labour debate, Charles Kennedy believes voters are ready to see ""modest"" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. That is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts. Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dems' approach to asylum and immigration, with Charles Kennedy stressing politicians should not ""foment an artificial debate"" about immigration and attacking Michael Howard's proposals for quotas. Once again, with the other two big parties singing similar songs on immigration, Charles Kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of Charles Kennedy's party. Charles Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over Charles Kennedy's party's election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be ""significant players"" in the poll. Charles Kennedy repeated Charles Kennedy's pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the next general election. Charles Kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a Labour government with a small majority would amount to a ""massive vote of no confidence "" in Tony Blair's government.

""We need to address the relationship between the Lords and the Commons in the next Labour manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the next Labour manifesto comes."" The lord chancellor currently has the role of Lords speaker. The lord chancellor is also head of the judiciary and a member of the Cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary. Boothroyd said Boothroyd believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of House of Lords speaker. ""Boothroyd would really like to see a Speaker of Lords,"" Boothroyd said. ""Boothroyd don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior the Cabinet minister and Speaker of Lords. ""Boothroyd want somebody there who is going to look after Lords and do a job there.",politics
politics_82,"New UKIP defection to 'Veritas' UKIP has lost one of UKIP's two London Assembly members to Robert Kilroy-Silk's's new political party, expected to launch on Wednesday. Damian Hockney said Robert Kilroy-Silk's would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a eurosceptic party. Damian Hockney said Robert Kilroy-Silk's had made Robert Kilroy-Silk's deputy party leader of 'Veritas'. Sources close to Damian Hockney said around eight other members of London UKIP were also planning to jump ship. Details of the coming week's events were hammered out at a meeting at Robert Kilroy-Silk's's Buckinghamshire home on Sunday, the BBC News Website was The news. The news came after UKIP the suspension of Mr Houston a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. a candidate, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. A spokesman for UKIP called on Damian Hockney to quit London Assembly. UKIP asserts that Damian Hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. Damian Hockney meanwhile told the BBC News Website: ""Damian Hockney believe that Robert Kilroy-Silk's can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of UKIP."" On the suspension of a candidate, UKIP said those who selected a candidate knew nothing of a candidate's views. a candidate is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: ""We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. ""The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which the English-speaking nations are uniquely able to do."" UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said the main issue would be that a candidate's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which his views were not.",politics
politics_83,"Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said Kilroy wanted to ""change the face of British politics"" as Kilroy launched Kilroy's new party. Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration. Kilroy told a London news conference that 'Veritas' party would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". the UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman says UKIP leader Roger Knapman is glad to see the back of Kilroy. Kilroy promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said 'Veritas' party hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. Kilroy said 'Veritas' party would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. New Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said 'Veritas' party was joining ""an already crowded field on the right of British politics"". On Thursday Kilroy is due to announce which constituency Kilroy will run in at the forthcoming general election - that will come amid speculation Kilroy has Kilroy's sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's's Ashfield seat. Kilroy was joined in 'Veritas' party by one of the UK Independence Party's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now 'Veritas' party's deputy leader. the UK Independence Party's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said 'Veritas' party will just be a parody of the UK Independence Party. Kilroy quit the UK Independence Party last week after months of tension as Kilroy vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of the UK Independence Party. Kilroy said Kilroy was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had ""gone AWOL"" after the great opportunity offered by the UK Independence Party's third place at last June's European elections. ""While the UK Independence Party has turned the UK Independence Party's back on the British people, Kilroy shall not,"" Kilroy said. ""Kilroy will be standing at the forthcoming general election. Kilroy shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes Kilroy believe in. ""And, unlike the old parties, the UK Independence Party shall be honest, open and straight."" one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader also left the UK Independence Party saying Kilroy would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for the UK Independence Party called on one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader to quit London Assembly. the UK Independence Party asserts that one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. the UK Independence Party's leader, Roger Knapman, has said Its leader, Roger Knapman, is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy. ""Kilroy has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after last June's European elections it became clear that Kilroy was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing Kilroy, now 'goodbye',"" Its leader, Roger Knapman, said. the UK Independence Party officials also argue Kilroy has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party Kilroy once wanted to lead. Veritas? It's the BNP in an expensive suit! It's all well and good Kilroy claiming, that Veritas? is a party that doesn't believe in ""lies and spin"", but the truth of the matter is, Veritas?'s completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that Veritas? will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend. In my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for Kilroy's anti-Islamism slurs which got Kilroy sacked from the television. I think that Kilroy's views regarding immigration are shared by many. It really is time that the UK government ceased to be a paper tiger on immigration. In addition as an Ashfield constituent I would be more than interested in Kilroy opposing Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's!! Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. Let's hope Kilroy, the UK Independence Party and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe. we as a country benefit enormously from we as a country's membership of the EU, we as a country need to be at the heart of Europe, leading Europe and driving Europe to where we as a country want to go, not running away from Europe. All mouth and trousers. A clown. Trouble is, any votes A clown. collects may just end up helping New Labour into a third term. Whatever Kilroy and the UK Independence Party do, none of Kilroy-Silk and UKIP's anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England. 'Veritas' party might gain support from right-wing England, but will have little impact in Wales or Scotland. Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow euro-sceptic parties to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. right-wing England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, right-wing England can't rely on the USA forever! At last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the forthcoming general election. The electorate is disillusioned with British politics. Kilroy has one agenda - our country - and I'll be voting for Kilroy. Both the UK Independence Party and RK-S are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. The interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of Kilroy-Silk and UKIP's bickering that who, in the overall scheme of things, really cares about Kilroy-Silk and UKIP's petty tiff? Many people believe Kilroy Kilroy. Kilroy may even believe Kilroy but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility. The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating. One can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what these extremists are and shun these extremists at the polls. I've always thought that Kilroy was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion. Brilliant, about time our country had a plausible party! Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior the UK Independence Party figures I can well understand why Kilroy feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. Hopefully the the UK Independence Party members who are interested in the political debate will support Kilroy's action. Fantastic news. Pro-Europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. The Conservatives are as confused as The Conservatives have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-Europeans are fracturing the extreme anti-Europeans into splinter groups that split any votes the extreme anti-Europeans might get in local, European and general elections. Kilroy's ego and vanity are Kilroy's own (and Kilroy's supporters') worst enemy. As a euro-enthusiast I could not be more delighted by Kilroy's behaviour. Kilroy took the UK Independence Party, and having exposed the UK Independence Party to ridicule by attempting a coup-d'etat, Kilroy is now setting about the serious business of dividing the UK Independence Party in two. The closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as I am concerned, but in any eventuality, Kilroy-Silk and UKIP will exhaust Kilroy-Silk and UKIP's energies fighting each other. If every politician with ambitions to lead every politician with ambitions to lead their party's party resorted to forming every politician with ambitions to lead their party's own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long! You've got to hand it to Kilroy for Kilroy's sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief. Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy Its leader, Roger Knapman, do agree with Kilroy's comments about the the UK Independence Party leadership, and like Kilroy Its leader, Roger Knapman, am also leaving the UK Independence Party. Its leader, Roger Knapman, believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the EU and to show our people what belonging to the EU really means. the EU's comments last week about Michael Howard's plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when the EU can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the EU and not individual member states. The sooner we leave the USA the better Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Kilroy has used a Latin name for Kilroy's new party, rather than a 'good old British' name? Is this indicative of the man - contradictory, vain and pompous? I think Kilroy has got a very good point. British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. no straight talking honest strong politicians are all interested in no straight talking honest strong politicians's own careers and not the people who put no straight talking honest strong politicians in power. As a result I feel we as a country's democracy is being abused and I want it stopped. If Kilroy lives up to half Kilroy's promises Kilroy will get my vote. Honestly, who really cares? Kilroy leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea. As one of Kilroy's East Midlands constituents I hope those who voted for Kilroy are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. I feel insulted by having Kilroy represent me in the European Parliament. the UK Independence Party tried hard to accommodate Kilroy, but Kilroy made it clear that only control of the UK Independence Party would satisfy Kilroy. Someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of the UK Independence Party's democratic nature. Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead the UK Independence Party are not. Kilroy tried to make it work, but those who lead UKIP didn't seem to want to grow up. Kilroy was left in the position of having to defend the UK Independence Party's gaffes to the media. 'Veritas' party seems a logical next step for Kilroy. Good luck to Kilroy, I say. Oh please! This is an amusing irrelevance. There is absolutely no chance of either of Kilroy-Silk and UKIP communicating a sensible and constructive 'Eurosceptic' argument. Kilroy-Silk and UKIP will play a key part in winning our country round to the idea of a reformed, more democratic, more dynamic Europe Union. Future generations will thank Kilroy for Kilroy's ridiculousness. The refreshing thing about Kilroy is that Kilroy is open, honest and straight. What other politician can claim this. Its leader, Roger Knapman, have a suspicion that Kilroy talks for a larger part of the electorate that Kilroy's critics would like. Its leader, Roger Knapman, shall be voting for Kilroy. The electorate of East Midlands voted not for Kilroy but for the UK Independence Party. Kilroy was made an MEP because of Kilroy's position on the UK Independence Party's party list. Kilroy has no mandate to represent East Midlands and should resign from the European Parliament. I wouldn't write off Kilroy. While Kilroy's a clown and a one man band at the moment, Kilroy's a populist and that's always dangerous.Kilroy clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters, that seems to be one of the factors in success. Good luck to Kilroy though I think Kilroy is doing more harm than good for both Kilroy's new party and the UK Independence Party because Kilroy-Silk and UKIP's vote base is not strong enough for Kilroy-Silk and UKIP to be successful and at the moment the UK Independence Party have the upper hand while 'Veritas' party are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle. The man I once found cringe worthy on Day time TV, could well turn out to be my country's knight in shining armour. Kilroy expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express views which are now more than common amongst society today. Kilroy has secured my vote, and many more like me. What's more, I look forward to the day when Kilroy claims victory, wrecks the EU, and rescues my great nation without a hair out of place and Kilroy's tan as perfect as ever! Great Stuff. The longer our country dithers over Europe, the richer we in Ireland become, as the only English-speaking country fully committed to Europe. Oh and send we as a country over those hard-working immigrants - we as a country's economy needs those hard-working immigrants. This is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, the UK Independence Party should try to resolve the UK Independence Party's differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the British people a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further. Thank goodness that Kilroy has gone - now the UK Independence Party at least has a chance in the forthcoming general election! It is very sad to see the cause of our country regaining our country's proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within the UK Independence Party. Kilroy could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, the UK Independence Party achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy. It is a great shame a major advance has been dissipated in in-fighting. the UK Independence Party has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of Kilroy's own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the UK Independence Party were interested in letting Kilroy join the English Democrats nor the New Party and take over the English Democrats nor the New Party's leadership speaks volumes. 'Veritas' party is the beginning of the end for Kilroy. If Kilroy believes in truth and democracy then Kilroy and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on he and the two assembly members's own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another. So the UK Independence Party was good enough for Kilroy to lead, not good enough for Kilroy to follow! Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name! Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in our country. Kilroy could be on the verge of something huge if Kilroy can broaden Kilroy's appeal beyond immigration. Kilroy is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy may just have courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Recruit the right colleagues, Kilroy, and Kilroy's time may have come! Well if Kilroy cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here Let's hope this is the start of both the UK Independence Party and Kilroy slipping into obscurity. Veritas? Veritas? will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand Veritas? since all modern schoolchildren do still learn Latin in the classroom do all modern schoolchildren not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of 'Veritas' party symbolises The whole essence of what RKS represents?",politics

The UK's biggest civil service union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system. The UK's biggest civil service union leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. ""For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that The government're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" PCS leader Mark Serwotka said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.""

politics_85,"'Debate needed' on donations cap A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. Fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the elections watchdog says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce a £10,000 cap for the future. the elections watchdog also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. There were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of almost £68m in reported donations to political parties from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to political parties but a new report says there are still public suspicions. the elections watchdog says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""While the elections watchdog are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, the elections watchdog do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says the elections watchdog's report. If there was to be a cap, a cap should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. Even without changes the elections watchdog does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. the elections watchdog also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And the elections watchdog suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the elections watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. a new report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. the elections watchdog also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. the elections watchdog chairman Sam Younger said: ""There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy political parties need to be adequately resourced. ""the elections watchdog's research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that people want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.",politics
politics_86,"Taxes must be trusted - Kennedy Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on taxes, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said. A day ahead of the government's's pre-Budget report, Kennedy used a speech to say Kennedy's party was facing up to ""painful economic realities"". Kennedy said the current level of taxation was about right, although Kennedy would put a new 50% tax on top earners. Other parties have that accusation Lib Dem of making uncosted promises. Kennedy made it clear Kennedy was determined to counter that accusation. Lib Dem have already published what Lib Dem say are the full costings for all Lib Dem's plans and a speech did not announce new policies. Speaking at the Commonwealth Club, Kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what a political party promised and what a political party was expected to deliver. Kennedy said. ""Budgets have to add up. Tough choices are needed in public spending."" Lib Dem would Those cutbacks ""low priority"" spending, including the government's's ID cards scheme and the Child Trust Fund. Those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, Kennedy said. Lib Dem argue Lib Dem were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. Now Lib Dem say the only simple tax rise Lib Dem want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. There would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the ""polluter who pays"". Lib Dem say Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of Labour's tax rises. Kennedy said: ""That contract with the people - that the government's will only tax fairly and will spend the people's money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about the political parties's plans. ""With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of Tories on taxes - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down."" Kennedy challenged the Treasury to open up the Treasury's books so the National Audit Office can report on the government's's performance. Tories co-chairman Liam Fox said: Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said ""If Kennedy is serious about making Kennedy's budgets add up Kennedy should start by explaining how Lib Dem would fund Lib Dem's 100 spending commitments. ""The reality is, Lib Dem lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face 'tough choices' would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year.

politics_87,"Election deal faltered over Heath role The Tories failed to hold onto power in 1974 after Liberals demanded Heath quit in return for co-operation. Documents released after 30 years reveal the failed negotiations by Heath following the dramatic February general election. Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government. But a coalition government partly collapsed over Heath's own role, prompting the Queen to ask Harold Wilson to form a Labour government. the dramatic February general election surprised the nation when the dramatic February general election created a hung parliament with no party in overall control. Heath had gone to the nation for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis, a miners' strike and the subsequent three-day week. Labour emerged with the most seats - but Labour's 301 MPs were 17 short of the number Harold Wilson needed to form a majority. Heath, believed Heath had the authority to remain at Number 10 providing the 14 Liberal MPs would support Heath's government. Heath said the Liberals could keep out Labour in three ways: lend ad hoc support to Heath's minority government, help draw up a Labour government's programme, or have up to three Cabinet members in a coalition with The Tories. According to Documents released after 30 years, the ""friendly and easy"" first meeting indicated that both Heath and Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe thought both Sir Edward and Mr Thorpe had the makings of a deal. Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe was in high spirits, having just led Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe's party to a historic jump in support. Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties. But Heath said a grand coalition of all three main parties was impossible because the Labour left was set against a grand coalition of all three main parties and both Sir Edward and Mr Thorpe settled on trying for a Conservative-Liberal pact. Hours later Heath's hopes of a deal unravelled as Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe's colleagues refused to support Heath. ""Heath said Heath was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with Heath's colleagues about Heath,"" reads a telephone memo for Heath. ""Mr Thorpe's colleagues feel Mr Thorpe's colleagues could not agree to serve as long as Heath is the prime minister. ""Asked if this was Heath's own view Heath said - no it was not, Heath am very close to Heath and thought Heath was by far the most able man we had and Heath would be perfectly happy to serve - it was only some of Heath's colleagues who were being difficult."" The following day, the stickling points had clearly become two-fold: Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe's colleagues wanted electoral reform and Heath's resignation. Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe told Heath: ""Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for Heath. ""Somehow Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe personally hope that we can work something out."" Four hours later, Heath called Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe back to Number 10 in a last attempt at a deal. The minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated. ""Heath said Heath was bound to tell Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe that Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe's colleagues had told Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe that Mr Thorpe's colleagues would not agree to serve under any other prime minister. Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of Heath's colleagues."" Documents show that Heath mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a Labour-led coalition. But Heath already knew Harold Wilson would not form a coalition with either the Liberals or The Tories because of the opposition of the Labour left. Within hours of Heath's final talks with Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, Heath told the nation Heath was resigning and the Queen invited Harold Wilson to form a new minority government.",politics

Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a ""decisive blow"" was struck at the coming election a ""decisive blow"" would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for A survey for the charity. Charity boss Gordon Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension. Charity boss Gordon Lishman also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to ""support us all in an ageing society"". ""Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to Older people's lives,"" Charity boss Gordon Lishman said. ""Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless Political parties address the demands and concerns of older people Political parties will not keep or attract older people's vote."" In A survey for the charity, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 never voted in general elections. Among the over-65s, 70% said 70% would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. Age Concern says the over-55s are ""united around"" key areas of policy the over-55s want the next government to focus on. For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%. A survey for the charity was welcomed by Tory shadow pensions secretary David Willetts. ""The pensioners''s voice must certainly be heard in the coming election as The pensioners' have never fitted into Blair's cool Britannia,"" Conservative shadow pensions secretary David Willetts said.

One poster depicted Tory leader Michael Howard and Tory leader Michael Howard's shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. the image pictured Tory leader Michael Howard swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. Others compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of Labour's website, saying members had preferred other designs. During Blair's interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Blair said: ""Blair've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so."" Pressed on whether Blair would draw attention to Tory leader Michael Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, Blair replied: ""The idea that Blair would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous.

politics_91,"Parties' plans for council tax Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill the increase 12.9%. Pensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase. Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, said Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, would rather go to jail. The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was ""fundamentally flawed"" and all three of the main parties have said the whole local government finance system has to change. Labour says Labour wants to retain the property-based tax but reform the property-based tax to make the property-based tax fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. Labour say Labour are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be ""radical reform"". The party says this year's increases will be the lowest in a decade. A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. An independent inquiry into its findings, the Lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005. The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who The Tories say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. The Tories say The Tories can save £4bn on ""government waste"", of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners' bills by an average of £340. It would not be means tested, say The Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for people's retirement. Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half households where council tax payers are over 65's bill, up to a maximum of £500. The Tories also say The Tories are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991's value in 1991 - because The Tories believe seven million of homes could move up a band. The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland. a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which The Liberal Democrats say would save at least £300m. The Liberal Democrats say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because the council tax puts a ""ceiling"" on what the richest pay. The Liberal Democrats says The Liberal Democrats would aim for a £5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a £7,000 allowance for the over-65s. After that income would be taxed up to £100,000.

A group of MPs has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. MPs and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost 600 hereditaries's seats. A group of MPs says A group of MPs can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because The government said The government were unlikely to succeed after opposition in Lords. Tony Blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of Lords in Labour's's manifesto.

""What could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our Parliament?"" A group of MPs believes pressure is growing for change and The government's current position is unsustainable.

Michael Howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who, Michael Howard claims, is ""ramming"" through Parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate. Michael Howard didn't say so, but the Tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so the prime minister can look tough in the run up to the general election And the Tories believe Tony Blair is using this one to suggest the Tories are soft on terrorism. Why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the Tories's offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the controversial new anti-terror measures, Michael Howard demanded. Michael Howard claims the Tories' offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws is the clearest indication that it is the Tories who are playing politics with this one by attempting to score cheap political points in Parliament. Is not the opposition against to the controversial new anti-terror measures ""in principle"", in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless? What this is really about, believes Tony Blair, is the Tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass, maybe even defeat the government. And that is more important to the Tories than national security. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with this one. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy preferred to state that, as with other issues like ID cards, the government's immediate instinct was authoritarian. As is Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy's habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy than the prime minister had been with Michael Howard - the prime minister prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting the prime minister believes the Lib Dems have, once again, just missed the point. Apart from all that, it was electioneering as usual. The very first question to the prime minister from Derby North's Bob Laxton asked the prime minister, in effect, if the prime minister would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. Later Birmingham's Sion Simon even went so far as to suggest the Tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now. the prime minister almost blushed. This was not the appropriate place to that announcement election day, the prime minister stammered. But can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away - an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 April for an election on 5 May is where the big money is in the Commons.

Bussard, Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990 Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems, ""high-thrust"" interplanetary flight is not possible, because system acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a 53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in Earth/moon space.

Farnsworth/Hirsch demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with Farnsworth/Hirsch's device back in 1969 but a 10**10 neutron flux was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim Bowery] ""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989. Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm innovation will make this possible; The PLASMAKtm innovation's unique pressure efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give The PLASMAKtm innovation compactness even in the multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [Jim Bowery strongly recommend that people take Paul M. Koloc seriously. Bob Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Soviet Tokamak, has recently declared Paul M. Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than the Soviet Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, The PLASMAKtm innovation looks like The PLASMAKtm innovation finally models ball-lightning with solid MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery] Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE archive; 2000 copies deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in the 1960s and 70s.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits. ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20 Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters. CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with Cassini's Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997. After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory, Cassini will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon arrival, Cassini performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn. Near the end of an orbit around Saturn, Huygens Titan Probe separates from its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan. its Cassini Saturn Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while Huygens Titan Probe enters and traverses the atmosphere of Titan to the surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, its Cassini Saturn Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the Probe mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface. One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that Titan's surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in Titan's upper atmosphere. liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto Titan's atmosphere and surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on Titan's atmosphere and surface. Experiments aboard both its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce its upper atmosphere. The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of Saturn's satellites and the major division in Saturn's rings. The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturn's rings.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity map. MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera. Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera. is currently (4/93) in transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for one martian year (687 days). TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched 8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years, substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean. ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over the Sun's poles. Launched in late 1990, ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. carries particles-and-fields experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera. Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. far out of the ecliptic plane, ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from Jupiter by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in February 1992. This bent ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles.'s path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. will pass over the Sun's south pole in the summer of 1993. ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles.'s aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles.'s perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft that's always further from the Sun than Earth is! While in Jupiter's neigborhood, ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. studied the magnetic and radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical detail, see the many articles in the same issue. OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro Yamada (). I'm attempting to track changes based on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome. 1993 Missions o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus] ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus] is to perform a wide-field sky survey in the ""soft"" (low-energy) X-ray spectrum.

Andromeda Software, Inc. P.O. Box 605 Amherst, NY 14226-0605 Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests. D = S S c K W : crater diameter in km S = (g /g ) : gravity correction factor for bodies other than g e t Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface e t gravity of the target body. This scaling is cited for lunar craters and may hold true for other bodies. S = (p / p ) : correction factor for target density p , p a t t p = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U a crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average rock on the continental shields. C : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth). K : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent) n empirically determined from the Jangle U a crater site. W = pi * d * delta * V / (12 * 4.185 * 10 ) : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3 g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid. An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing asteroids. Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in diameter. More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985): Asteroid Number of objects Impact probability Impact energy diameter (km) (impacts/year) (* 5*10^20 ergs) assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb. References: Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

space_15,"In article <C5133A.G@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins) writes: Titan IV launches ain't cheap Granted. But that's because titan IV's are bought by the governemnt. Titan III is actually the cheapest way to put a pound in space of all US expendable launchers. In that case it's rather ironic that MM are doing so poorly on the commercial market. Is there a single Titan III on order? The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt to market Commercial Titan. MM're basically happy with MM's government business and don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially. A secondary problem is that Commercial Titan is a bit big. MM'd need to go after multi-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly. MM also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get launch facilities started properly. If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from the pad used for the Mars Observer launch for a year or so. There have been a few CT launches. Mars Observer was one of a few CT launches. So was that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of Intelsat's brothers that reached orbit properly.

In Japan, technological development are now under way to economically collect uranium dissolved in seawater. The total quanity of uranium dissolved in seawater is estimated to be about 4.6 billion tons, a huge amount when compared with ground uranium reserves"" Paul F. Dietz hate to pour cold water on The total quanity of uranium dissolved in seawater, but currently seawater extracted uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market. Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb. Right now, there are mines closing because mines can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich the ore present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles). Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb. ""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense. Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price. Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the 20th century? Not bloody likely. New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate. Uranium from seawater is interesting, but Uranium from seawater's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency. Paul F. Dietz ",space

If the head of the operations section of NASA spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment the head of the operations section of NASA would have very little to nothing for future projects. If the head of the operations section of NASA did that, sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and the head of the operations section of NASA would be popular, however starting a few years after the head of the operations section of NASA had retired the head of the operations section of NASA would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.

Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints have not been lost. the Saturn V blueprints are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm. The problem in re-creating Saturn V is not finding the Saturn V blueprints, The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch from. By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design. Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give Investigators associated with NASA missions an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early in a mission. There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small. Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2 RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and the Apollo 13 lunar module's SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980]. To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to pursue are: A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel Salisbury in ""Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG Controversy,"" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies indicate that chemicals released from the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) in reality have only a minute impact, both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study, Charles Jackman. The atmospheric modelling study of the Space Shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies. three independent theoretical groups involved Dr. Michael Prather and Maria Garcia (NASA/GISS), the author of the quoted study, Charles Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc.). The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere. The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine: Industrial sources: 300,000,000 kilograms/year Natural sources: 75,000,000 kilograms/year Shuttle sources: 725,000 kilograms/year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the total stratospheric chlorine sources. The effect on ozone is minimal: global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares. The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible. The launch schedule of the space shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time. Theoretical results of this study have been published in _Space Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness. Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue) start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes, you're dying. The limits are not really known.

This is a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example. What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts, never mind destroy the astronauts's bodies, according to the Kerwin team's medical/forensic report. the astronauts were killed when the crew cabin hit the water at circa 200MPH, and the astronauts's bodies then spent several weeks underwater. the astronauts's remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team examined their bodies, their bodies were sent off to be buried. You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because the shuttle orbiter can't get there. the shuttle orbiter is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks. Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the Earth. the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between the Earth's surface and low Earth orbit. Taking the shuttle orbiter higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit spacecraft. [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.] There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face. a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery: 35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13 (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west). Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face is artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't know the address) to study a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face. The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years.

For the most up to date information on upcoming missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center. Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news frequently. The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks (). The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102, says: ""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other advantages with the tilt maneuver (roll program) are performance gain, decreased abort maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of the horizon. the tilt maneuver (roll program) is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target in second stage."" This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try to interpret. 1) We wait until the vehicle clears the tower before rolling. 2) Then, we roll the vehicle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the ""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly negative angle (""a negative q-alpha""). This causes a little bit of ""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z direction) and a little bit of ""downward"" force ""alleviates structural loading."" We have to be careful about the wings -- the wings're about the most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle. 3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or to change orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain""). 4) The new attitude (after the roll) allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if the crew had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver complexity""). 5) The new attitude (after the roll) improves the ability for ground-based radio antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles""). 6) The new attitude (after the roll) allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine. 7) The new attitude (after the roll) orients the vehicle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east (usually). This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit. Remember: velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. the vehicle has to have a large horizontal component to the vehicle's velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit. This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give The new attitude (after the roll) to begin with? Why does the vehicle need to roll to achieve The new attitude (after the roll)?"" The answer is that the pads were leftovers from the Apollo days. the vehicle straddles two flame trenches -- one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust. (You can see the effects of this on any daytime launch. one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is fluffy white steam. Watch for the difference between the ""top"" [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way The access tower and other support and service structure were for the Saturn V's's. (A side note: the Saturn V's's also had a roll program. Don't ask me why -- I'm a the vehicle guy.) I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. a buddy in Ascent Dynamics added that the ""roll maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw. The roll component of the ""roll maneuver"" is performed for the reasons stated. The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance. yaw is used to determine the orbital inclination. the ""roll maneuver"" is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element array.

Whether or not the US would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go. Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).

On the other hand: Regress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by Griffin, because that would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the $ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a mission to mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera They were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into the same old stuff.

There are four different ideas, and DC-X will probably end up trying all of four different ideas. (This is from talking to Mitch Burnside Clapp, who's one of the DC-X test pilots, at Making Orbit.) (1) Pop a drogue chute from the nose, light the engines once DC-X stabilizes base-first. Simple and reliable. Heavy shock loads on an area of structure that doesn't otherwise carry major loads. Needs a door in the ""hot"" part of the structure, a door whose operation is mission-critical. (2) Switch off pitch stability -- DC-X is aerodynamically unstable at subsonic speeds -- wait for DC-X to flip, and catch DC-X at 180 degrees, then light engines. A bit scary. (3) Light the engines and use thrust vectoring to push the tail around. Probably the preferred method in the long run. Tricky because of the fuel-feed plumbing: the fuel will start off in the tops of the tanks, then slop down to the bottoms during the flip. Keeping the engines properly fed will be complicated. (4) Build up speed in a dive, then pull up hard (losing a lot of speed, DC-X's L/D is not that great) until DC-X's headed up and the vertical velocity drops to zero, at which point DC-X starts to fall tail-first.

space_51,"Archive-name: space/astronaut Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $ First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA announcement. Q. How do I become an astronaut? A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you want to do a military flying career anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission specialist"". If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must. After that, the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply. NASA's problem is not finding qualified people, but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason, many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job. Get a Ph.D. Specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil. Forget computer programming entirely; computer programming will be done from the ground for the fore- seeable future. Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner. Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term effects are poorly understood. For that matter, avoid any other significant medical unknowns.) If you can pass a jet-pilot physical, you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor. Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants. (And, also, that you will be a credit to NASA after you are hired: public relations is a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and proper.) The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie. Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point, and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent. Keep your nose clean. Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby; experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs. Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988, 43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut). If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but NASA offer you a job at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you do look interesting but NASA want to know you a bit better first"". Think space: NASA want highly motivated people, so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation. Keep trying. Many astronauts didn't make it the first time. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center Houston, Texas Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates Astronaut Candidate Program National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a need for Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed. Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered. All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation program. the Space Shuttle Program Description The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. The Space Shuttle Orbiter then returns to Earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew. The Space Shuttle Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station. The Space Shuttle Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter The Space Shuttle Orbiter. Users of the Space Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries. The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot, and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are assigned. The commander, the pilot, and mission specialists are NASA astronauts. Pilot Astronaut Pilot astronauts server as both the Space Shuttle commanders and pilots. During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle, crew, mission success and safety in flight. the pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other payload operations. Mission Specialist Astronaut Mission specialist astronauts, working with both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots, have overall responsibility for the coordination of the Space Shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of the Space Shuttle systems, as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on Mission specialists's assigned missions.

space_53,"Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $ This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes (), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew Wiener () contributed the section on Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material posted by Yoshiro Yamada (). MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with the rocket's antenna, so the onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the Range Safety Officer destroyed the rocket. Although a bug in the guidance software is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, a bug in the guidance software was actually a transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was This error from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative of radius). This error led the guidance software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if normal minor variations of velocity were serious, leading to incorrect compensation. MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December of 1962, and MARINER 2 returned information which confirmed that Venus is a very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978). MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964,'s protective shroud failed to eject as MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was placed into interplanetary space. Unable to collect the Sun's's energy for power from the Sun's's solar panels, MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, soon died when MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964,'s batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit. MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4. MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964,, did reach Mars in 1965 and took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as MARINER 4 flew by Mars. MARINER 4 found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the geological and biological sense. MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. MARINER 5 reconfirmed the data on Venus collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information that Venus's atmospheric pressure at Venus's surface is at least 90 times that of Earth's's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface of an ocean. MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, MARINER 6 and 7 failed to take away the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic measurements of MARINER 4. MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed. MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971. MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, returned information on Mars that no other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once flowed across Mars. MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, also took the first detailed closeup images of Mars's two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. MARINER 10 did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover, plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles Mercury in four Earth's days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. MARINER 10 revealed Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which makes up 75 percent of Mercury. PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS) PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet PIONEER 1 through 3's main objective - to photograph MOON close-up - but PIONEER 1 through 3 did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth's and MOON, including new data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth's. PIONEER 1 through 3 had failures with PIONEER 1 through 3's rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6. PIONEER 4 was a MOON probe which missed MOON and became the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun's in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally designed to flyby Venus, but PIONEER 5 was scaled down and PIONEER 5 instead studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth's out to 36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to this time: PIONEER 6 through 9 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969. PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER 11 followed PIONEER 10 in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever to do so. PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER 12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER 12) made the first radar studies of Venus's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus 2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the Venusian atmosphere in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the Venusian atmosphere, while four small probes descended by parachute towards the planet's surface. Though none were expected to survive to the planet's surface, the Day probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before the Day probe's batteries failed. RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. RANGER 1 and 2 were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems left RANGER 1 and 2 in useless low orbits which quickly decayed. RANGER 3, the launch on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of MOON, but problems during the launch caused MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, to miss MOON and head into solar orbit. MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, did the attempt to take some images of MOON as MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, flew by, but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt. RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964,, but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside, the first U.S. probe to reach MOON, albeit without returning data. RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to PIONEER 1 through 3, lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed MOON and drifted off into solar orbit. RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: RANGER 6 through 9 were to send back live images of the lunar surface as RANGER 6 through 9 headed towards an impact with MOON. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when RANGER 6's cameras did not operate. RANGER 6 through 9 performed well, becoming the first U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965. LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit MOON and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO missions of 1969-1972. LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside. All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were essentially successful in All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967's missions. All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967 were the first U.S. probes to orbit MOON. All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967 were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions. The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of MOON without sinking into the soil (before this time, it was feared by some that MOON was covered in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to this time. Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the first U.S. probes to soft land on MOON, taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of APOLLO 12 to Earth's. SURVEYOR 7, the last of The SURVEYOR series, was a purely scientific mission which explored the Tycho crater region in this time. The probe was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June 19, 1976, and The probe set down on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia on July 20, 1976. The probe soon began The probe's programmed search for Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether PIONEER 1 through 3 found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of The probe's surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars's sky was pinkish in color, not dark blue as scientists originally thought (Mars' sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere). The probe set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as The probe's cameras could image. The The probe orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when The probe ran out of attitude-control propellant. The probe was switched into a weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped The probe would keep functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command had been sent to The probe accidentally telling The probe to shut down until further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the engineers' efforts through May of 1983. An interesting side note: The probe's lander has been designated the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station until the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station can be attached to VIKING 1's lander by a manned expedition. The lander was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in Utopia Planitia. The lander accomplished essentially the same tasks as The lander's sister lander, with the exception that The lander's seisometer worked, recording one marsquake. its sister lander had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in 1978, which prompted its sister lander being shut down that July. The probe was shut down on April 12, 1980. The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025. The probe was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March 5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched August 20, 1977 (before The probe), and flew by Jupiter on August 7, 1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot VOYAGER 2's way from outer planet to outer planet. The probe could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto, but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up. Between PIONEER 1 through 3, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, the 4 giant planets's satellites, and the 4 giant planets's rings has become immense. VOYAGER 2 discovered that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere. When PIONEER 1 through 3 reached Saturn, PIONEER 1 through 3 discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep their rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas''s appearance was startling: one massive impact crater gave Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' the Death Star appearance. The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of their rings. Braids, kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain. VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts, continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus Uranus was highly monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that Uranus's magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered. In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather, including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?) both VIKING orbiters are expected to last for about two more decades. both VIKING orbiters's on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond Pluto. both VIKING orbiters's next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause. Since there have been so many Soviet probes to MOON, Venus, and Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions: LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed MOON and became first craft in solar orbit. LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959. LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959. ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was also a test for future Mars missions. LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on MOON in 1966, returned images from surface. LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit MOON in 1966. LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966. ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 accomplished similar missions through 1970. ZOND 6 through 8 were unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle. LUNA 16 - First probe to land on MOON and return samples of lunar soil to Earth's in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to MOON's surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973. LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions lost enroute in 1961. VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with VENERA 3. VOYAGER 2 ceased transmitting just before encounter in February of 1966. No images were returned. VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966. VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles similar in 1969. VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar mission. VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission. VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of Venus's surface in 1983 more detailed than PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER 12). VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in March of 1986. MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased enroute the following year. ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965. MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle Mars in 1971. MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971. MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to fire, probe went on into solar orbit. MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in 1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. probe MARINER 9. MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into Martian surface. MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit with Lander's flyby bus. PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars's largest moon, Phobos. Mars' largest moon, Phobos failed enroute in 1988 due to human/computer error. PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Mars' largest moon, Phobos. Mars' largest moon, Phobos did enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week before scheduled Mars' largest moon, Phobos landing. While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have yet been taken with Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even interstellar probes. More intensive studies of MOON, Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on Mars has been planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of the former Soviet Union (now the Commonwealth of Independent States)'s space program remains to be seen. SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km on March 11, 1986. SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) is carrying three instru- ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth's swingby by SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) on January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to Earth's's. The closest approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The geocentric distance was 88,997 km. an Earth swingby by Sakigake is the first planet-swingby for a Japanese spacecraft. During The closest approach, SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) observed the geotail. Some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth's-swingby will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's's radius)), and the third October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re). HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth's orbit on January 24, 1990. HITEN, a small lunar probe, was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten once in orbit. HITEN, a small lunar probe looped out from Earth's and made HITEN, a small lunar probe's first lunary flyby on March 19, where HITEN, a small lunar probe dropped off HITEN, a small lunar probe's 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around MOON, joining the Unites States and USSR. its 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO remained in orbit around MOON. An apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists to lose track of its 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO. its 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO's rocket motor The rocket firing of Hagoromo on schedule on March 19, but its 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The rocket firing of its 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO was optically confirmed using the Schmidt camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan. HITEN, a small lunar probe, made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using Earth's's atmosphere. HITEN, a small lunar probe, made a close approach to MOON at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15, 1992 at the height of 423 km from MOON's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and fired The lander's propulsion system for about ten minutes to put The lander into lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the approach: Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) Period : 4.7 days I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions, and periodical sources on space probes. the following works, categorized in three groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions, and periodical sources on space probes is by no means complete; the following works, categorized in three groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions, and periodical sources on space probes is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can add pertinent works to the following works, categorized in three groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions, and periodical sources on space probes, it would be greatly appreciated. Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library. Some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market bookstore. General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author): J.

I recommend very detailed and technical books on every space probe mission it has launched after you first study some of the books listed above. Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's's Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER, SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Earth's Moon Luna, the MARINER missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions, but also show you what else was going on with Earth's at the time events were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you probably know. Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration.

space_57,"SSF is up for redesign again. Let's do redesign right this time! Let's step back and consider the functionality we want: [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality. Shuttle and SSF failed to meet Shuttle and SSF's targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of the military and commercial users's payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie the military and commercial users's payloads to Shuttle, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication. Over $50 billion has been spent on Shuttle and SSF with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization. Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation. Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc. Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed. SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization. [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights. The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails. The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO. [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO. This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude. Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size. So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips. The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from Earth thru a VR interface. AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts. [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit. I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice ground engineers's skills. Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc. Once a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills is working, a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards. By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting the program's cost. For a fraction of old SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits. N.B., we can apply the successful constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting space exploration's cost and increasing space exploration's functionality. Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return. The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost. Nick Szabo ",space

Whether or not the US would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go. Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and James Thomas Green think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run). Thus the US would have concentrated on the Moon. Great speculation - James Thomas Green remember being proud on behalf of all the free world (you think that way when you are seven years old) that the US had got there first. Now James Thomas Green'm almost sorry that it worked out that way. James Thomas Green guess the soviets would have taken the victory seriously too, and would almost certainly not have fallen victim to the complacency that overtook the US program. Perhaps stretching to match US efforts would have destabilized the soviets sooner than it did in fact - and in the tradition of Marvel Comics 'What If', this destabilization in the Brezhnev era might have triggered the third world war.

The biggest question mark would be the lead target chemistry and the on-line processing of all the elements being incinerated. (Paul Dietz), quite frankly (Paul Dietz)'ll believe that this is really going to work on the typical trash one needs to process when (Paul Dietz) see them put a couple tons in one end and get (relatively) clean material out the other end, plus be able to run (relatively) clean material off (relatively) clean material's own residual power.

Given (Paul Dietz) postings, (Paul Dietz) can't say (Paul Dietz) am surprised, though. Well, pardon (Paul Dietz) for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging (Paul Dietz)'s forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to go the 'right' way on the energy curve). Now, where *did* (Paul Dietz) put those sackcloth and ashes? [(Paul Dietz) was not and am not 'pretending' anything; (Paul Dietz) am *so* pleased (Paul Dietz) are not surprised, though.] No, it is nothing like perpetual motion. Note that (Paul Dietz) didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was ""sounds almost like perpetual motion"", which (Paul Dietz), at least, consider a somewhat different propposition than the one (Paul Dietz) elect to criticize. Perhaps (Paul Dietz) should beg (Paul Dietz)'s pardon for being *too* precise in (Paul Dietz)'s use of language? The physics is well understood; the energy comes from fission of actinides in subcritical assemblies. Folks have talked about spallation reactors since the 1950s. Pulsed spallation neutron sources are in use today as research tools. Accelerator design has been improving, particularly with superconducting accelerating cavities, which helps feasibility. Los Alamos has expertise in high current accelerators (LAMPF), so (Paul Dietz) believe Los Alamos know what Los Alamos are talking about. (Paul Dietz) will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through this process as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different 'run' for each actinide) when (Paul Dietz) see them dump a few tons in one end and pull (relatively) clean material out the other. Once the costs, technological risks, etc., are taken into account (Paul Dietz) still class this process with the idea of throwing waste into the sun. Sure, it's possible and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable approach? And (Paul Dietz) still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with something like this process, as opposed to what kind of energy you would really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy recovery. Are we talking ounces, pounds, or tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of material and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days, weeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a non-decimated time scale, (Paul Dietz) see ;-))? The real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being built is that there isn't any reason to do so.

Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Universiteit van Utrecht sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond. De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel. Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren. Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren. het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I, Universiteit Utrecht.

space_72,"Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $ This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to  (Jon Leech). If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading the FAQ with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck). The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#. Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because References give more complete information than any short generalization. Questions fall into three basic types: 1) Where do I find some information about space? Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There are other sources, use other sources, too. The net is a place for open ended discussion. 2) I have an idea which would improve space flight? Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day. 3) Miscellanous queries. Miscellanous queries are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of FAQ postings. Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet. Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?] Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent. Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth 100 posts). Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST not SPACE. Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all references.) Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize! Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the 'reply' function of mailers will work. Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone will get on TV anyway. Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals (use carriage returns).

Wasn't there a ""plain"" flavor too? spacefood sticks looked more like some kind of extruded industrial product than food -- perfectly smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends. Kinda scary. The taste is hard to describe, although Shag Rob Unverzagt remember The taste fondly. The taste was most certainly more ""candy"" than say a modern ""Power Bar."" Sort of a toffee injected with vitamins. The chocolate Power Bar is a rough approximation of the taste. Strawberry sucked. An other post described The chocolate Power Bar as like a ""microwaved Tootsie Roll"" -- which captures the texture pretty well. As for taste, spacefood sticks were like candy, only not very sweet -- does that make sense? Shag Rob Unverzagt recall liking spacefood sticks for spacefood sticks's texture, not taste.

space_76,"In <1993Apr3.233154.7045@Princeton.EDUlije@cognito.Princeton.EDU (Elijah Millgram) writes: A friend of EDU (Elijah Millgram) and EDU (Elijah Millgram) were wondering where the expression ""pushing the envelope"" comes from. Anyone out there know? Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power. When graphed, flight constraints for speed/AOA/power define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where that aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky. Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'. Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions. Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly. Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during the F-16's high-speed taxi tests). EDU (Elijah Millgram)'m sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about this process (and then some).

Kennedy was gone by 68\69, the war was still on is the east, I think the Soviet Program today would have stalled badly and the goal of the moon by 70 would have been dead with Nasa trying to figure were they went wrong. If the Soviets had beaten the US, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but the US also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the moon). Whether or not the US would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go. Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run). Thus the US would have concentrated on the moon. I speulate that: +The Saturn program would have been pushed into the 70s with cost over runs that would just be too evil. Nixon still wins. +The Shuttle was never proposed and Skylab never built. +By 73 the Soviet Program today stalled yet again under the fuel crisis. +A string of small launches mark the mid seventies. +By 76 the goal of a US man on the moon is dead and the US space program drifts till the present day. /~~~(-: James T.

In general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent between three categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET, and other resources available on one of three categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special 'servers'. The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between The space and astronomy discussion groups. One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays mail to all recipients of the list. In addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below. A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. Usenet 'netnews' is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Usenet 'netnews' separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a 'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro', and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors ''spost' submissions (called 'articles' in Usenet 'netnews' terminology) on Contributors ''s local machine, which sends ' submissions (called 'articles' in netnews terminology) to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which an article was posted. Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive Usenet 'netnews', Usenet 'netnews''s more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make Usenet 'netnews' the preferred option.

Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?

space_86,"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space. This is how a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays went After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State. I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly got the standard bozo treatment. That is, I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly, in order to determine that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly were not bozos, and to familiarize an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us with the material, and to screen the material, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with the material. Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Patty Murrays aide, and I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly ended up talking to an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays for 45 minutes, with I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly ending a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays, and an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays still listening. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific. Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer. There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly brought up. But, with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State being new, I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly wanted to entrench I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO. Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly hit Solar power satellites as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly hit the environmental stand on that. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as kids get older and find out that kids havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, kids go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances kids might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc Jobs provided in those sectors. Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do. And he asked questions on this point. I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly ended by telling our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly wanted our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly want to make sure that the results from efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly asked that our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO. In the middle I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act separately, the guy was VERY interested in the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act. the guy asked some questions about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and seemed like the guy wanted to jump on the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and contact some of the people involved with the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, so something may actually happen immediatly there. The last two things I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly did were to make sure that some of the people involved with it knew that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that some of the people involved with it could feel free to call I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly any time with questions, and if I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly didn't know the answers, that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly would see to it that questions got to people who really did know the answers. Then finally, I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly asked for an appointment with the senator our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State. the guy said that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly would get on the list, and the guy also said that knowing our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State, this would be something that our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State scheduled, since our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State is only in Washington State 1 week out of 6 these days. All in all I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly felt like I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly did a pretty good job. John.",space

It's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement. YF-102 was completely ours and KC-135 was bailed to us. The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts. Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.

All that  (Victor Laking) know is that there were apparently two sightings at drastically different times of a small planet that was inside Mercury's's orbit. Beyond that,  (Victor Laking) have no other info. the apparent sightings of Vulcan were apparently spurious. There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury's. The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's's observed perihelion precession and the value Mercury's observed perihelion precession should have had according to Newtonian physics. Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on an extensive set of observations and calculations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations. Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since Leverrier had predicted Neptune's existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus Leverrier's inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury's. But alas, 'twere not so. Mercury's's perihelion precesses at the rate Mercury's perihelion does because the space where Mercury's perihelion resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass. This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's's synthesis of Albert Einstein's's earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry. The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of the General Theory of Relativity most noteworthy strengths is that the General Theory of Relativity accounts for the precession of Mercury's's perihelion almost exactly. (Exactly if you use Simon Newcombe's numbers rather than Leverrier's.) Of course not everybody believes Albert Einstein's, and that's fine. But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury's using radar have been fruitless. -Bill Gawne ""Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe are the laws of the universe."" - G.

space_96,"I am sure Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me. But here is how i understand it. At Speed, Near supersonic. The wind behaves like a fluid pipe. The wind becomes incompressible. So The wind has to bend away from the wing edges. AS the wing thickens, the more the pipes bend. If the pipes have no place to go, the pipes begin to stall, and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag). If you squeeze the fuselage, so that the pipes have aplace to bend into, then drag is reduced. Essentially, teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage. That is where the wings are subtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage. pat",space

space_98,"NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). Gibbons've typed the following press release in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in the following press release. Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance Gibbons, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station in the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station's deliberations on the redesign of the Space Station. A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station. Each option would cover the total expenditures for the Space Station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds. Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget. For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years. Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station. Generally, the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station focused upon administrative topics and used an organizational session of the advisory committee to get acquainted. the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station to consider. Gibbons also announced that the United States and the United States's international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the course of the redesign of the space station. To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign of the space station on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the Station Redesign Team can make use of the Station Redesign Team's expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- hope to benefit from the expertise of the Station Redesign Team in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign of the space station is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving The overall goal of the redesign effort. Gibbons reiterated that, ""the President's is committed to the Space Station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the redesign of the space station represents. However, the President's also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and the United States."" NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.",space

Now, Claxton owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year. And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot. For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain Claxton's leap in form. In previous seasons, Claxton also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London Claxton has re-focused Claxton's attentions.

sport_29,"The year: An Irish Athletics Year The year won't be remembered as one of Irish athletics''s great years. The year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably, seems to herald an upcoming Olympiad. But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics' - or to be more accurate, the lack of the true strength of Irish athletics. Sonia O'Sullivan's's Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn't have been surprised. At the start of The year, an O'Sullivan had been earmarked as Ireland's's best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. Less than a week before the games, Irish athletics' was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO. Cathal Lombard's shattering of Mark Carroll's national 10,000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when Cathal Lombard was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation. Cathal Lombard quickly held Cathal Lombard's hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from Irish athletics'. Back at pre-Olympic ranch in Greece, it must have seemed that things couldn't have got any worse but things very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with walker Jamie Costin's life after being involved in a car crash near Athens. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. Sonia O'Sullivan's scraped into the women's 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, Ireland's attempted to delude Ireland's into believing that Sonia O'Sullivan's might be in the medal shake-up. As it happened, Sonia O'Sullivan's went out the back door early in the women's 5K final although there was nothing undignified about the way that Sonia O'Sullivan's insisted on finishing the women's 5K final over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. It later transpired that Sonia O'Sullivan's had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the women's 5K final although typically, Sonia O'Sullivan's played down the effects of a stomach bug. Amazingly, Sonia O'Sullivan's was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while Sonia O'Sullivan's's major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of Sonia O'Sullivan's in competition. At least Sonia O'Sullivan's managed to make it to Athens. At the start of The year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for Northern Ireland. an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel gave it a lash but an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel's achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit. James McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on James McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee's television screens. 800m hope James McIlroy never got near James McIlroy's best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended James McIlroy's hopes of making the plane. Gareth Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best Gareth Turnbull could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked Paul McKee's Athens ambitions and both Paul McKee and Gareth Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. Zoe Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after Zoe Brown had achieved the Athens B standard but a vote of confidence never came. As the summer ended, stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly's competitive spikes. Catherina McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on Catherina McKiernan after several injury-ravaged years. Dermot Donnelly and Dermot Donnelly's Annadale Striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team-mates's friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at their friend and clubman Andy Campbell's home on 18 December.

sport_33,"Athens memories soar above lows Well, it's goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens. Obviously, there's no getting away from the differing fortunes of Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe. But I want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics. One of my favourite Olympic moments was Kelly Holmes's success in the 800m. Winning the 800m. was the key to Kelly Holmes's success because if Kelly Holmes won the 800m. then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. Kelly Holmes had been full of ""should Kelly Holmes, shouldn't Kelly Holmes?"" thoughts about going for Hicham El Guerrouj's Olympic double in Athens. I thought why wouldn't Kelly Holmes do the 800m., the 800m.'s Kelly Holmes's best event? It was such good fun to commentate on Kelly Holmes's 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of Kelly Holmes's Athens story. The victory for the British men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games. I think the four of the British men's 4x100m relay team - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis - knew deep down that The victory for the British men's 4x100m relay team was the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis's best chance of a medal. the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis did lift the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis's game when the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis knew something was really at stake. Hicham El Guerrouj's's Olympic double is a much bigger achievement than Kelly Holmes's on a global scale. Hicham El Guerrouj's was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. As soon as Hicham El Guerrouj's had added the 5,000m crown and I had finished commentating, I jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave Hicham El Guerrouj's a big hug. Hicham El Guerrouj's is one of the few African runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and Hicham El Guerrouj's loves to hear all the Roger Bannister stories. Hicham El Guerrouj's is someone I enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my French and Hicham El Guerrouj's's English are not very good. What happened to Paula Radcliffe in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. There were a set of circumstances around Athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which I think has been greatly misunderstood. Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. That was Paula Radcliffe's heart and not Paula Radcliffe's head reacting. Paula Radcliffe had a lot of little things going wrong in Paula Radcliffe's preparation and on the day. Things like niggling injuries, not being able to do all Paula Radcliffe's running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of Paula Radcliffe. I think Paula Radcliffe came to the start line in Athens physically and emotionally drained. And if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road even the smallest thing will hit you like a brick wall. The positive thing to take from Paula Radcliffe's Olympics it that Paula Radcliffe will have learned a lot from Paula's Olympics and so will a lot of people - including me. Purely as a race, Paula Radcliffe's victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. Paula's victory in the New York Marathon was so nip-and-tuck between Paula Radcliffe and Kenya's Susan Chepkemei and you don't usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. Paula's victory in the New York Marathon was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula Radcliffe showed real ""bouncebackability"". And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the New York Marathon was going to pan out. Kelly Holmes and the 4x100m boys' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team. the British team should be concerned that the British team're not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level. The only individual men's finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m. I am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? And that's where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as the British team did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy. Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and Dani Barnes was the highest finisher for the British team. The thing is if the British team don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond. I tell you what I really enjoyed this year, Benita Johnson winning the world cross country championships back in March. In the absence of Paula Radcliffe, we tend to think of the world cross country championships as something of an African preserve. So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. To be honest, I'm getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially Balco. I just wish all the drug scandals, especially Balco would come to a head so we can move on. Having said that, I'm always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to all the drug scandals, especially Balco and not turning a blind eye anymore. And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. We need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. As regards the case against Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over Kostas Kenteris for a while. The bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying the sport.",sport

sport_39,"Radcliffe tackles marathon tasks Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of Radcliffe's career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday. Back under the spotlight of public scrutiny Radcliffe will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where Radcliffe failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the New York City Marathon. The ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's's belief that an athlete's can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on the wall, ""Are Every runner strong enough to finish?"" The question could hit Radcliffe hard after Radcliffe was unable to complete Radcliffe's last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says Radcliffe must draw on Radcliffe's past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. ""There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'"" Sports psychologist Hugh Richards told BBC Sport. ""Radcliffe has got all those great runs in Radcliffe's history as well as the two upsets in Athens. ""Radcliffe must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. ""If Radcliffe were to change Radcliffe's preparation and tactics that would be madness. ""Radcliffe wants to start rebuilding Radcliffe's confidence through performance accomplishment."" For much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first Radcliffe will have proved Radcliffe's critics wrong. But if Radcliffe fails to triumph, Radcliffe risks being labelled a has-been and Radcliffe's profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues. ""Athletes need to try and stay focused on Athletes's internal controls and ignore external questions,"" explains Sports psychologist Hugh Richards. ""Radcliffe must not get caught up in someone else's agenda."" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed Radcliffe is already aware Radcliffe will be exposing Radcliffe to more public scrutiny in New York. ""Radcliffe just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of Radcliffe now,'"" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling told BBC Sport. ""Radcliffe's just doing what Radcliffe wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it."" Radcliffe described Radcliffe's decision to enter the New York marathon as ""impulsive"" but Radcliffe is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Radcliffe's aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure Radcliffe is still enjoying running but Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says Radcliffe must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. ""You can't change history,"" warned Sports psychologist Hugh Richards. ""Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. ""Radcliffe has to figure out what sort of things will Radcliffe feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race."" The course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. The course from Staten Island to Central Park is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through Central Park testing the legs' final reserves. Radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. ""It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,"" said Yelling, Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling a marathon runner. ""But that is only for long-term health and fitness. ""When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Radcliffe."" Sports psychologist Hugh Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. ""The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped Radcliffe up in Athens,"" Sports psychologist Hugh Richards said. ""And The heat stress just isn't going to be there in New York, The heat stress's been taken out of the equation."" Radcliffe concedes Radcliffe will probably learn a lot from Radcliffe's bad experiences in Athens in time. And Sports psychologist Hugh Richards and Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling agree Radcliffe could turn the trauma to Radcliffe's advantage, starting in New York. ""How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,"" argues Sports psychologist Hugh Richards. ""One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn massive set backs into opportunities."" And Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling says: ""Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling think this will probably make Radcliffe."" ""Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling think it will drive Radcliffe on and Radcliffe'll come out of it a better athlete.""",sport

Holmes said: ""Holmes am very disappointed that Holmes have been forced to withdraw. ""Holmes can hardly walk at the moment and Holmes won't be able to do any running for two or three weeks although Holmes'll be keeping fit as best Holmes can."" Holmes will have now have intensive treatment in South Africa. Holmes made a cautious start to the season but looked back to Holmes's best when Holmes stormed to the 1,000m title at the Birmingham Grand Prix 10 days ago. After the Birmingham Grand Prix and more progress in training, Holmes revealed Holmes had decided to compete at the European Indoors before Holmes's plans were wrecked last weekend. ""On Saturday night Holmes pulled Holmes's hamstring running the last bend on Holmes's final 200m of the night,"" said Holmes. ""Holmes was going really, really well when Holmes felt a massive spasm in Holmes's left leg and Holmes's hamstring blew. ""Holmes saw the doctor here and the doctor has said a hamstring injury is not serious but it's frustrating missing Madrid when Holmes knew Holmes was in great shape."" Holmes has now been advised by Holmes's coach Margot Jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely Holmes will compete again until the summer.

sport_56,"What now for Kelly Holmes? Last April, Kelly Holmes spoke to the BBC Sport website about Kelly Holmes's loneliness, Kelly Holmes's fight to stay fit and Kelly Holmes's decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the Olympics. It just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for even the most meticulous and measured athletes. Four months later, Kelly Holmes stormed to double Olympic gold and has since been made a Dame, won the BBC Sport Personality of the Year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. With so much time spent in the spotlight, Kelly Holmes has increasingly dropped hints that Kelly Holmes's ambition on the track has begun to wilt. And when asked about Kelly Holmes's plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead, Kelly Holmes has repeatedly chosen to tick the ""don't know"" box. Kelly Holmes has now pulled out of this weekend's European Indoor Championships, where Kelly Holmes was selected for both the 800m and 1500m, because of a hamstring injury. But should we be surprised if the Olympic champion over both the 800m and 1500m decides Kelly Holmes just does not feel like racing anymore? ""Well, it's a lot easier being the double Olympic champion, being feted by everybody, than training to be at the top in middle distance running,"" points out former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram. ""You have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you're very talented."" Kelly Holmes's drive and determination have always been unquestionable - Holmes' drive and determination is the reason Kelly Holmes has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see Kelly Holmes finish Kelly Holmes's career empty-handed. But alarm bells start ringing when the Kent athlete begins questioning Kelly Holmes. ""Will Kelly Holmes have as much commitment, desire and energy to go through a major championship?"" Kelly Holmes asked in the New Year. ""That is what Kelly Holmes don't know."" At 34, Kelly Holmes will also be aware that time is running out. US 400m and 200m legend Michael Johnson, a five-time Olympic gold medallist, retired shortly after US 400m and 200m legend Michael Johnson, a five-time Olympic gold medallist's 34th birthday as did Britain's double Olympic champion decathlete Daley Thompson. The physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for Holmes, who has already admitted Kelly Holmes ""doesn't like the training anymore."" Whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double Olympic champion will spur Kelly Holmes's opponents on. Kelly Holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. Unless Kelly Holmes is certain Kelly Holmes has a strong chance of winning any race, Kelly Holmes will not step onto the track. But if the Kent athlete finds the form that fuelled Kelly Holmes's ambitions last summer, there are more prizes up for grabs. The day after completing Kelly Holmes double in Athens, Kelly Holmes revealed Kelly Holmes would still like to win Kelly Holmes's first indoors title. Kelly Holmes's wish could easily be met in Madrid before Kelly Holmes goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled, such as a first gold at the World Championships in Helsinki. There is just one small truth which could gnaw away at Kelly Holmes's motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard Kelly Holmes trains, nothing Kelly Holmes wins now can surpass Kelly Holmes's achievements in Athens. On the other hand, if her achievements in Athens cannot be matched shouldn't her achievements in Athens be at least shared and celebrated? ""You don't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double Olympic champion,"" agreed former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram. ""You want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it's a fantastic feeling. ""former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram think deep down Kelly Holmes wants to run. former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram think Kelly Holmes will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not Kelly Holmes runs in the major championships is much less certain."" Athletics fans had every reason to believe Athletics fans would see Kelly Holmes tearing up the track again. After Kelly Holmes's Olympic glory Kelly Holmes emphatically denied Kelly Holmes planned to retire. So, why is Kelly Holmes dragging Kelly Holmes's heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again? ""Kelly Holmes's just Kelly,"" explains former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram. ""Kelly Holmes's always been like that. ""Kelly Holmes enjoys people trying to guess what Kelly Holmes is going to do next. Kelly Holmes knows every time Kelly Holmes makes a pronouncement now a pronouncement's headline news. ""Kelly Holmes has to figure out for Kelly Holmes what it is Kelly Holmes wants and that will be based on athletics decisions, whether Kelly Holmes can be competitive, if Kelly Holmes is fit enough to put Kelly Holmes's neck on the line. ""And if Kelly Holmes decides not to run again, no-one is going to turn round and say 'Kelly Holmes're making the wrong decision.'""",sport

sport_58,"European medal chances improve What have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects. It was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around. The best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts Sarah Claxton's right up there and if Sarah Claxton's repeats that in Madrid Sarah Claxton's will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday's performance was that Sarah Claxton's was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been Great Britain's best hurdler for some time now and I think Diane Allahgreen was surprised to be beaten by Sarah Claxton's. And knowing that Sarah Claxton's got the better of Diane Allahgreen in a head-to-head race will give Sarah Claxton's confidence. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from Allan Scott. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid. Phillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with Phillips Idowu's hair, but also with Phillips Idowu's leap of 17.30m, which puts Phillips Idowu at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with Phillips Idowu before the competition and Phillips Idowu was really looking forward to getting out there. Phillips Idowu feels Phillips Idowu is in great shape and has some big jumps inside Phillips Idowu - but then Phillips Idowu always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips Idowu to jump like that is a good performance. Phillips Idowu is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if Phillips Idowu does some consistency then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show Kelly Sotherton is developing. Kelly Sotherton picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles. Kelly Sotherton will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but Kelly Sotherton has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far. Kelly Sotherton has a complicated training regime where different people help Kelly Sotherton with different disciplines but a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines seems to be working really well. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but Jason Gardener wasn't at Jason Gardener's best. I chatted to Jason Gardener afterwards and Jason Gardener knows it was an off-day for Jason Gardener. Jason Gardener's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but defending champion Joice Maduaka had to pull out with a chest infection. If defending champion Joice Maduaka had made the final I think Jeanette Kwayke would have gone a bit quicker. Janine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on Janine Whitlock's return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that Janine Whitlock is Great Britain's best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine Whitlock has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think more domestic competition would help Janine Whitlock. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Mark Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for Trinidad and Tobago so Mark Findlay could still compete for Great Britain. Rabah Yusuf, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. Rabah Yusuf came to Great Britain as a high jumper but damaged Rabah Yusuf's toe, started doing more running and found Rabah Yusuf's talent. So we shall have to see what happens to Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf.",sport

While Holmes left Athens as the star of Team GB, it was their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, who carried expectations before the Olympic Games. their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, went into the Athens event as favourite but their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, dropped out after 23 miles in tears. their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe,'s decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, again pulled out with eight laps remaining. But their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, helped put their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, Olympic trauma behind their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, with a thrilling win in November's New York Marathon. Britain's men's 4x100m relay team grabbed some last-gasp glory for Britain's men's 4x100m relay team after a poor start to the Olympic Games. It seemed as though Athens would be the first Games where Britain's men's 4x100m relay team would fail to win a medal with Michael East the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. But Darren Campell, Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis made amends in the sprint relay. Darren Campell, Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis held off favourites the USA to win Britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. Jason Gardener added the Olympic relay crown to Jason Gardener's World Indoor title over 60m and, just like Holmes, finally lived up to Jason Gardener's promise in the year. Kelly Sotherton completed Team GB's athletics medal haul in Athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. Kelly Sotherton won Kelly Sotherton's first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003. But it was a different story for Britain's defending champion Denise Lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. Mark Lewis-Francis has ruled out retiring while Kelly Sotherton is tipped to build on Kelly Sotherton's success. The Athens Olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for Steve Backley, who Backley's departure from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. Steve Backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one Olympic bronze. And Steve Backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin's departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete Dean Macey, who came fourth in Athens. The continued improvement of sprinter Abi Oyepitan and long jumper Chris Tomlinson also boosted Team GB. Sadly, the 2004 Olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. On the eve of the 2004 Olympics, Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash. Kenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and Katerina Thanou have since been charged by the Greek authorities and await trial. At the 2004 Olympics, Adrian Annus (hammer), Robert Fazelas (discus) and Irina Korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of Adrian Annus (hammer), Robert Fazelas (discus) and Irina Korzhanenko (shot)'s titles because of doping issues. Hungarian compatriots Adrian Annus (hammer) and Robert Fazelas (discus) both refused to give urine samples while Irina Korzhanenko (shot) tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. The fallout from the THG scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in Olympic year. Britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of Dwain Chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in February after testing positive for steroid THG. American Kelli White was suspended and stripped of American Kelli White's world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. And world 400m champion Jerome Young landed a life ban from US chiefs after a second doping offence. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva's way to the World Indoor and Olympic titles. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva's rivalry with compatriot Svetlana Feofanova livened up the field events. Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic Olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m. And though there was no Paula Radcliffe in the London Marathon, there was plenty of drama as Kenyans Evans Rutto and Margaret Okayo took the titles. Kenyans Evans Rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. Margaret Okayo also had to battle back after mistiming Margaret Okayo's tactics but clinched victory on Margaret Okayo's debut.",sport

World 100m champion Kim Collins clinched second spot ahead of world 60m record holder and Scott's training partner Maurice Greene.

Belgian Kim Gevaert, who will be one of the favourites for next month's European title, took second while American Muna Lee was third. There was disappointment for British pair Jeanette Kwakye and Joice Maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively.

Ethiopia's's failed in Ethiopia's's bid to smash compatriot Berhane Adere's world 3,000m record but still won the event in emphatic style. The Olympic 5,000m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third, finishing in eight minutes, 33.05 seconds - the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event. Britain's's Jo Pavey bravely decided to go with Defar as Britain's Jo Pavey strode away from the field and took second in a season's best 8:41.43. Kenyan also missed out on the indoor 1500m world record, which Hicham El Guerrouj has held for the last eight years.

sport_69,"Record fails to lift lacklustre meet Yelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but Yelena Isinbayeva's achievement could not hide the fact lacklustre meet was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham. And hey, there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record. Apparently, Yelena Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love Yelena Isinbayeva to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see Yelena Isinbayeva have a go at 5m in competition. Mind you, every time Yelena Isinbayeva breaks the indoor record Yelena Isinbayeva gets $30,000 so Yelena Isinbayeva can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. Kelly Holmes looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Agnes Samaria, who came second let Kelly Holmes get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly Holmes dominated the race, so beating Agnes Samaria, who came second is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly Holmes. My gut feeling is that Kelly Holmes would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but Kelly Holmes just hasn't convinced Kelly Holmes Kelly Holmes is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. Jason Gardener started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason Gardener has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason Jason Gardener is struggling to maintain Jason Gardener's pace through to the finish. It would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only Mark Lewis-Francis hadn't got Mark Lewis-Francis disqualified. Mark Lewis-Francis was blatantly playing the false-start game to Mark Lewis-Francis's advantage, but it tripped Mark Lewis-Francis up and made Mark Lewis-Francis look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start game you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark Lewis-Francis is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark Lewis-Francis or Jason Gardener yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of lacklustre meet. Something else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Indoor Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain a fast early pace and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape Jo Pavey would have given Meseret Defar a real run for Jo Pavey's money. Jo Pavey had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. has only just come over from the USA, so Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. may not be that sharp and I still think Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, Kenenisa Bekele was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Kenenisa Bekele as Kenenisa Bekele has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Meseret Defar complained to Meseret Defar's coach after the race that Meseret Defar could not get Meseret Defar's breath properly.",sport

Kelly Holmes, former hurdler Alan Pascoe and former sprinter Frankie Fredericks - who is now an IOC member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. You'd have thought all these athletes, who have been running for most of all these athletes, who have been running for most of their lives's lives, wouldn't think it would be that bad. But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson, who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times.

When I'm at home, I get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days I was in London's, I was in a pressurised situation, but I found it easy to relax by running. On Wednesday, the presentations to the IOC team did not finish until the early evening, so I just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run. We had an early start on Thursday because we had to visit all the Olympic sites around London's, that was pretty shattering, but when we got back to the hotel, I got back on the treadmill. On Friday evening I went along to the special dinner at Buckingham Palace which was a nice occasion. I never feel guilty about eating, especially when I'm exercising. And because Friday was a rest day I didn't have to feel bad about missing my training either. Anyway, I managed to do another quick run on Saturday ahead of the final IOC presentations, before heading home for my daughter's birthday. When I was in London's I did all of my runs on the treadmill, which isn't the same as exercising outdoors. One of IOC's technical staff from Australia ran alongside me one day. We talked about the Sydney Olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. I do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning. But when you're gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement. It was good to get out on the road for my long run on Sunday. After the week I'd had I was a bit concerned I wouldn't be able to complete my long run on Sunday. But I coped with my long run on Sunday very well and, even though it was bitterly cold, I put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then. - This year Steve will donate all the proceeds from Steve's London Marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.Steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of Steve's marathon training for the BBC Sport website.Steve will be raising money through the Steve Redgrave Trust which supports the Association of Children's Hospices, the Children With Leukaemia charity, and the Trust's own project which aims to provide inner-city schools with rowing equipment.",sport

Marcus Bent missed Everton's best chance when Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile,'s feet. Wayne Rooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and Wayne Rooney was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off.

But that was the cue for Man Utd to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. Quinton Fortune gave Man Utd the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Cristiano Ronaldo's cross from eight yards after Cristiano Ronaldo had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith.

But Moyes has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. Moyes said: ""Moyes believe that Moyes should set the record straight by conceding that Beattie dismissal was right and correct.""

The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich shared information about a consumer fraud lawsuit on The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich's Twitter account. The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich accused Google of using “deceptive and unfair practices to obtain users’ location data”. users’ location data is exploited for advertising, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of Google's revenue. Google collects detailed information about Google's users, including its users's physical locations, to target users for advertising. Often, this is done without users's consent or knowledge. The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich wrote on Twitter: “Google collects detailed information about Google's users, including its users's physical locations, to target users for advertising. Often, this is done without its users's consent or knowledge.” The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich told the Washington Post that Google has been trying to find “misleading ways” to obtain information from users who try to opt out of data collection. The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich added that Google may be the “most innovative company in the world” but Google is not above the law. The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich's office’s investigation of Google was initiated after reading a 2018 Associated Press report, which detailed how Google users are “lulled into a false sense of security” by privacy options, including the option to disable location history. The investigation found that many Google services on Android devices (and also iPhones) store location data even if the user selects privacy settings which purport to prevent Google from doing so. The findings were confirmed by computer scientists at Princeton University. a consumer fraud lawsuit specifically alleges that Google maintained location tracking for certain features, including weather and search engine queries, after the user disabled app-specific location tracking. Only when the user turns off broader system-level tracking did Google stop tracking location. “His office’s brought forward a consumer fraud lawsuit to put a stop to Google's deceptive collection of user data, obtain monetary relief and require Google to disgorge gross receipts arising from Google's Arizona activities,” The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich added in another tweet. The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich has asked for the courts to force Google to pay back any profits Google may have earned by exploiting data fraudulently acquired from Arizonans. the Washington Post posits that Arizona’s state fraud laws may also allow for a $10,000 fine per violation. The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich's action comes on the heels of a lawsuit from New Mexico AG Hector Balderas, who sued Google for allegedly collecting children’s data without required parental consent - a possible violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 1998. According to a consumer fraud lawsuit, Google harvested data (including YouTube activity, voice recordings, physical locations, browser activity, and contacts) from free Chromebooks provided to schools through the G Suite for Education platform and then used data (including YouTube activity, voice recordings, physical locations, browser activity, and contacts) for personalised advertising, up until April 2014. New Mexico AG Hector Balderas, who sued Google for allegedly collecting children’s data without required parental consent had previously sued Google and other companies for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 1998 in 2018. Although Google has made some compromises in recent years, such as making it easier to delete location data, Google remains the target of lawmakers and activists for the aggressive data-harvesting practices on which Google's business model relies. Google and other US tech giants are facing a number of major regulatory and legal challenges around the world, mostly relating to antitrust and privacy. Google said in a statement to media: “The Arizona Attorney General (AG) Mark Brnovich and the contingency fee lawyers filing a consumer fraud lawsuit appear to have mischaracterised Google's services. Google have always built privacy features into Google's products and provided robust controls for location data. Google look forward to setting the record straight”",technologie

According to the official news agency most of 12,575 net cafes were closed down because most of the net cafes were operating illegally. Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. The move is the latest in a series of steps China has taken to crack down on what China considers to be immoral net use. the official news agency said China net cafe culture crackdown was carried out to create a ""safer environment for young people in China"". Rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. 12,575 net cafes were shut in the closing months of 2004. China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to. Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in few people's homes. This is not the first time that China has moved against net cafes that are not operating within China's strict guidelines. All the 100,000 or so net cafes in China are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. Logs of sites people visit are also kept. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use net cafe opening hours were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. During the crackdown following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of net cafes get permits to operate. In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. At the same time Chinese authorities introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. The Reporters Without Borders group said in a report that Chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.",technologie

Digital guru told the World Service programme Go Digital Digital guru hoped a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) would become an education tool in developing countries. Digital guru said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood"". Digital guru said the child could use a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) like a text book. Digital guru described a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, ""MIT's Media Labs have to get the display down to below $20, to do this MIT's Media Labs need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. ""The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny the fat down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Digital guru said this was a not for profit venture, though Digital guru recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Digital guru published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do children's work on. While The concept was popular amongst the children, The concept initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Digital guru has adapted The concept to Digital guru's own work in Cambodia where Digital guru set up two schools together with Digital guru's wife and gave the children laptops. ""We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the children cherish 25 laptops, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook."" Digital guru wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. ""Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."" Digital guru plans to be distributing the laptops by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. ""In China the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. $17 per child per year's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.""",technologie
technologie_4,"Technology gets the creative bug The hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time that dance around The hi-tech and the arts worlds and offered creative and technical help when required. Often creative and technical help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. But that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. And vice versa. UK telco BT is serious about the idea and has the initiative's launch UK telco BT's Connected World initiative. the idea, says UK telco BT, is to shape a ""21st Century model"" which will help cement the art, technology, and business worlds together. ""UK telco BT are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology,"" said Frank Stone, head of UK telco BT's business sector programmes. Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes looks after several ""centres of excellence"" which UK telco BT has set up with other institutions and organisations, one of which is focused on creative industries. To mark its Connected World initiative's launch, a major international art installation is to open on 15 April in Brussels, with a further exhibit in Madrid later in the summer. They have both been created using UK telco BT's technology that UK telco BT has been incubating at UK telco BT's research and development arm, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. Using a 3D graphics engine, the type commonly used in gaming, Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell have created a virtual, story-based, 3D model of Brussels's Coudenberg Cellars. Brussels' Coudenberg Cellars have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of Coudenberg Palace, an historical seat of European power. a virtual, story-based, 3D model of Brussels' Coudenberg Cellars can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th Century until a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th Century was bricked up in the 19th Century. ""a river was integral to Brussels's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to Brussels that a river disappeared,"" said Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell. ""Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell hope that by uncovering a river, we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present, and appreciate the flow of modernity, once concealing, but now revealing a river."" In Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell's previous works Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell used the Quake game graphics engine. the Quake game graphics engine is the core component of a video game because the Quake game graphics engine handles graphics rendering, game AI, and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. the engines are so time-consuming and expensive to create, the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games. UK telco BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) was also used in 2003 in Encounter, an urban-based, pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical, on-the-street action. Because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in the artists's worlds, new features were added to BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) in order to handle the complex data sets. But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new, and many keen coders, designers, games makers and animators argue that what many keen coders, designers, games makers and animators create is art art itself. As more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street, enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload photos to the web for instance, creativity will become an integral part of technology. The Orange Expressionist exhibition last year, for example, displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the UK to create an interactive installation. Technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential, not least because Technology as a way of unleashing creativity gives people something to do with people's technology. Big businesses know it is good for Big businesses to get in on the creative vein too. The art world is ""fantastically rich"", said Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like UK telco BT want to get in with The art world. Between 1997 and 2002, the creative industry brought £21 billion to London alone. the creative industry is an industry that is growing by 6% a year too. The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net, according to Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes. ""The partnership between artists and technologists is not just about putting art galleries and museums online,"" Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes said. ""The partnership between artists and technologists is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem."" With broadband penetration reaching 100% in the UK, businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use the technology. The creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. The creative drive is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries, or more patent ideas for tech companies. ""What we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking. ""We are creating a future cultural drive for the economy,"" said Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes.",technologie

The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling local organisations in charge of water irrigation to coordinate local organisations in charge of water irrigation's actions. More than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure. The 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September. The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations. ""The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology,"" said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies).

The Board of Irrigation Users which runs The 14 telecentres, aims to make A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using The 14 telecentres as internet cafes. One of the key elements of A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology is the Agricultural Information System, with the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website's flagship huaral.org website. There, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley's vital irrigation systems. ""Water is the main element that unites the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley. Water is a precious element in Peru's coastal areas, because Water is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of Water,"" Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes told the BBC News website. A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology also allows farmers to look beyond farmers's own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world. The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) says the involvement of the farmers has been key in A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology's success. ""Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology; the people feel it belongs to the people,"" said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for the people's enthusiasm. ""The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. But The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) have also had a great feedback when The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives's lives."" So far, the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in Peru. ""A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology is a pilot project, and the Huaral programme promoters have been very keen on the model's cloning potential in other places,"" underlined Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. The The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. ""It was already dark when the technicians realised the technicians didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator, so the technicians turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs,"" recalls Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. ""The logical answer was 'the technicians don't sell any', so the technicians had to wait until the next morning to do the testing.""

Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said some IE flaws were known about, and although Microsoft had not seen any attacks exploiting some IE flaws, Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave a critical flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in media player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in Microsoft's software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as ""critical"". Microsoft's latest releases came the week that Microsoft announced Microsoft was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make Microsoft's own security programs.",technologie

Anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card spread widely online. Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card. Like many other Windows viruses, a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card plunders Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card across the web to new victims. To be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card. the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug poses as an electronic Christmas card but anyone opening the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces. a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card's subject line says ""Merry Christmas"" and translates ""Merry Christmas"" into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. The message in the body of the e-mail reads: ""Happy Holidays"" and The message in the body of the e-mail too is translated. On infected machines a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card. a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card is thought to have spread most widely in South America, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year.

The 1991 laptop was chosen because The 1991 laptop was one of the first ""lightweight"" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. US magazine Mobile PC has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. US magazine Mobile PC specified that gadgets also needed to be a ""self-contained apparatus that can be used on gadgets's own, not a subset of another device"". ""In general US magazine Mobile PC included only items that were potentially mobile,"" said US magazine Mobile PC. ""In the end, US magazine Mobile PC tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,"" US magazine Mobile PC concluded. The oldest ""gadget"" in The Apple Powerbook 100 is the abacus, which US magazine Mobile PC dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadgets in The Apple Powerbook 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first ""successful"" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13. Sony's third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. ""Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna's Like A Virgin emenating from Madonna's Like A Virgin's first CD player?"" asked US magazine Mobile PC. Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th). Why worry about mobile phones. Soon mobile phones will be subsumed into the PDA's / laptops etc. What about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. For it's time, a technological marvel! Sony Net Minidisc! Sony Net Minidisc! paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without my NetMD. A laptop computer is not a gadget! A laptop computer's a working tool! The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket calculator. I think The Sinclair Executive should be there as well. How about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these things are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors. Are the people who created an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? the mobile phone has revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly. Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker?? An interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three weeks on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100 did not make the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100 DOS compatible. What's an Apple Powerbook 100 ? an Apple Powerbook 100's out of date - not much of a ""gadget"". Surely an Apple Powerbook 100 has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves ? an Apple Powerbook 100 has to be the mobile phone. No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule. The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises could be carried around and shown off. All top 10 are electronic toys, so an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. I say this as Swiss Army Knife only made No 20. Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of Sinclair QL's time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing was so bad!!! Apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else. Utter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank the sextant and the marine chronometer as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the marine chronometer is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. No competition. I'd also put Apple's Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise Vulcan Inc's Flipstart would be at the top. How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radios and TVs? The swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 years ago. Still wearing and using The swiss army knife. a lot! The swiss army knife. stood the test of time. Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there.

The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers oferr mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site? It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that. The Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices. The Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without the Sinclair Spectrum I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now.

Google's said the feature, available only in the US, ""adds useful links"". But some users are concerned that Google's's dominant position in the search engine market place could mean Google's would be giving a competitive edge to firms like Amazon.com. a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of a webpage has given permission. If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google's toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon.com's website. It could mean online libraries that list ISBN book numbers find online libraries that list ISBN book numbers are directing users to Amazon.com whether users like it or not. Websites which have paid for advertising on Websites which have paid for advertising on their pages's pages may also be directing people to rival services. Dan Gillmor, founder of Grassroots Media, which supports citizen-based media, said a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites was a ""bad idea, and an unfortunate move by Google's"". In a statement Google's said a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that Google's welcomed feedback from users. Google's said: ""The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button, and web pages The user views will never be modified. ""In addition, the user can choose to disable a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites entirely at any time."" a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites has been compared to the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft by some users. the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by Microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by Microsoft. Google's said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft. Some users said a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites to work on websites's pages or if websites received revenue for any ""click through"" to a commercial site. Cory Doctorow, European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation, said that Google's should not be penalised for Google's's market dominance. ""Of course Google's should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies Google's chooses.

Cory Doctorow, European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation said the only objection would be if users were forced into using a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites or ""tricked into using a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites"".",technologie
technologie_10,"UK net users leading TV downloads British TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research. New episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after New episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, Web tracking company Envisional said. ""It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,"" said Ben Coppin from Web tracking company Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said a report, and an estimated 20,000 of about 100,000 people were from within UK. Fans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in UK. But in some cases, said a report, people were able to watch the new episodes in UK before US audiences on the west coast of UK. ""Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the net,"" explained Ben Coppin from Envisional. ""Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the net is now a global video recorder."" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term ""time-shifting"" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer. Within half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because recorded episodes tend to be shorter then full-length films, recorded episodes can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly. According to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say broadband helps 40% of homes with broadband pick and choose the programmes 40% of homes with broadband want to see or that friends have recommended. The Web tracking company Envisional reports said that The industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. the Interactive Media Player (iMP) let people download programmes people held the rights to up to eight days after programmes it held the rights to had already aired. the Interactive Media Player (iMP) is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year.

IBM said $100m (£52m) will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said IBM had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for Linux. In 2004 IBM said IBM had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. $100m (£52m) will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add Linux-based elements to IBM's Workplace software.

Now with 69.2% of the world's browser user share – a measure of browser activity calculated by California-based analytics company Net Applications – Google's's Chrome has no equal, at least in popularity. Rivals like Microsoft's Edge, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple's Safari eke out single digits, while niche browsers under Rivals like Microsoft's Edge, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple's Safari fight over the smallest scraps. It's no surprise, then, that when Chrome speaks, everyone listens, whether about each browser upgrade – something Computerworld tracks in the What's in the latest Chrome update? series – or about Google's's plans for the future. Every Chrome upgrade is accompanied by enterprise-centric release notes that highlight some of the planned additions, substitutions, enhancements and modifications. Computerworld've collected the most important for this what's-coming round-up. Just remember, nothing is guaranteed. As Google's says: ""They might be changed, delayed, or canceled before launching to the Stable channel."" Chrome 84: Full-page TLS 1.0, 1.1 warnings Last year, Google's spelled out the stages of warnings Google's would put in front of Chrome users about obsolete TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 or 1.1 encryption. A first step – a ""Not Secure"" alert in the address bar – was taken in January 2020. With Chrome 81, Chrome was to display a full-page interstitial alert that interrupted attempts to reach the destinations secured with TLS 1.0 or 1.1. That schedule, however, was abandoned in early April. [ Become a Microsoft Office 365 administrator in record time with this quick start course from PluralSight. ] Now, it's Chrome 84, slated for release July 14, that is to contain the page-sized warning. IT administrators can disable both warnings with the SSLVersionMin policy. Setting the SSLVersionMin policy to ""tls1"" allows Chrome to connect to TLS 1.0- and 1.1-encrypted sites sans alerts. the SSLVersionMin policy will work until January 2021, when the SSLVersionMin policy will be deprecated. Chrome 84: Risky downloads, rescheduled Starting with Chrome 84, Chrome will warn users when executable files begin executable files's downloading from a secure page (one marked as HTTPS) but actually transfer executable files's bits over an insecure HTTP connection. ""These cases are especially concerning because Chrome currently gives no indication to the user that the user's privacy and security are at risk,"" Joe DeBlasio, a software engineer on the Chrome security team, wrote in a Feb. 6 post announcing the scheme. At the time, Chrome 81 was pegged to begin the warnings. But as with the TLS 1.0 and 1.1 alerts, the warnings were the change in early April, pushed back to later versions of Chrome. Google's did not say aloud what prompted the change, but the change likely was related to the March decision to pause Chrome's release cadence and when distribution was restored, abandon Chrome 82, skipping from Chrome 81 to May's 83. With Chrome 85, set to ship Aug.25, Google's will drop the hammer, barring those executable files from downloading. Over several more versions, Google's will warn, then block, additional file types, including (in order) archives such as .zip; ""all other non-safe types, like .pdf and .docx; then finally image files, such as .png. For example, Chrome 85, set to ship Aug.25 will institute warnings for archives (and Chrome 86 will block archives).

Even as we consider revelations Facebook shelved internal research suggesting Facebook's algorithms generate divisiveness, Apple has been forced to reject damaging claims against Apple's contact tracing tech currently spreading on Facebook. Exposure Notification is not spying on you Numerous hysterical myths concerning the Apple/Google contact tracing technology are being circulated on Facebook. A series of posts claim Exposure Notification will allow authorities to track people’s's locations and monitor who people’s meet – which is precisely what Exposure Notification tries not to do. This is not correct. [ Keep up on the latest thought leadership, insights, how-to, and analysis on IT through Computerworld’s newsletters. ] The solution requires individuals use a government-approved app and that individuals consent to sharing any information. Not only this, but both Apple and Google have barred governments from harvesting GPS data or requiring users to share personal information when using a government-approved app. An Apple spokesperson told Reuters: “You will still need to download an app from a public health agency to use Exposure Notification.” How Exposure Notification works In order to work, The solution relies on random Bluetooth identifiers shared between devices. random Bluetooth identifiers shared between devices forms a record of proximity but does not include location data. [ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ] When both Apple and Google announced both Apple and Google's work, Apple and Google promised that any apps using Exposure Notification “must require users to consent before sharing a positive test result, and the ’keys’ associated with users's devices, with the public health authority.” Users should also be able to turn off exposure notifications at any time. both Apple and Google are attempting to create a contact tracing solution that gathers as little personal information as possible, and have previously promised to delete Exposure Notification once the current crisis has passed. The intention of Exposure Notification is that government or health authorities can use the API to build apps with which to monitor the disease outbreak. What is contact tracing? Contact tracing is seen as a way to help control the disease outbreak. The information should warn people when people have been exposed to the diseases. This could enable life to return to something a little more like business as usual, while also saving lives – though the efficiency is limited if people refuse to use the apps. The tech-based solution won’t be the only tool used for this: Many governments are hiring tens of thousands of human contact tracers to interview COVID-19 sufferers in order to find out who COVID-19 sufferers have interacted with. Apple and Google continue development Apple and Google both released APIs for both Apple and Google's technology earlier this month. APIs for their technology are designed to make it possible for both Android and iOS devices to work together for contact tracing using officially sanctioned government apps. both Apple and Google are also this effort a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms, both Apple and Google said in April. “this functionality is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if more individuals choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities,” both Apple and Google explained at April. “Privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and both Apple and Google look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders."" Who is using these apps ? Apple and Google have said 23 countries and several U.S. states have requested access to both Apple and Google's APIs. The first app to make use of the Apple/Google API has appeared in Switzerland, with a Latvian initiative not far behind. There are some governments who want to gather all the information for analysis on servers some governments who want to gather all the information for analysis on servers they control control, but the Apple/Google model does not enable this; instead, analysis takes place on the device. The idea is that by retaining control of data on user devices, privacy is maintained. Those countries attempting to gather data on user devices in a far less private, centralized fashion are having problems creating solutions that actually work. One app tested in the UK is glitchy, drains batteries and doesn’t work well between platforms, among other problems. That’s a shame, given that One app tested in the UK now has a higher death rate per million than any other country in the world, and could probably use an effective solution.

The question of bloggers and what rights bloggers have to say what bloggers want on bloggers's sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what employees have said on employees's personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in. ""This is a big messy argument,"" explained Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee. Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee added: ""It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs."" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, ""is part of the whole messy conversation."" ""If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have bloggers tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. ""Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,"" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish a blog in minutes to a global community. ""That is the essential difference.

technologie_16,"Finding new homes for old phones Re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too. Research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. The Forum for the Future research found that the low cost of old mobile phones means old mobile phones can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. But Forum for the Future found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let old phones rot in landfill sites. The Forum for the Future research reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK. Of approximately 15 million mobile phones, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. The slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at Forum for the Future. ""It's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,"" said James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. Many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials Many of these older phones are made of into the wider world, said James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. Far better, James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send the phone overseas where the phone can enjoy a second lease of life. ""Forum for the Future've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,"" said James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future, ""but there's a strong social argument too."" Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. ""Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular's an interesting country because Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular has a really crap fixed line network,"" said James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future, ""and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."" But the relatively low wages in Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. ""The affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,"" James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future said. Reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as The Forum for the Future research revealed that almost one-third of Romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. reconditioned handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said: ""Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner,'s wages. Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, am a single parent - keeping in touch with Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner,'s daughter is important to Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner,."" ""keeping is the only way Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, can afford to have a phone,"" Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said. James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of the UK's mobile mountain made it overseas. But, James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. ""If its more than a few years old people are not going to want it,"" James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future said.",technologie

Sony's, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console for three years, will unveil the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console at a technology conference. the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors. the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. Sony's has said the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games. Special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game, Sony's told an audience at the E3 exhibition in Los Angeles last year. the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console could also be marketed as an ideal technology for televisions and supercomputers, and everything in between, said Kevin Krewell, the editor in chief of Microprocessor Report. the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on PlayStation 3 at launch. Details of the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console will be released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. Some details have already emerged, however. When put inside powerful computer servers, the Cell consortium expects the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second. the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. IBM said IBM would start producing the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. The first machines off the line using the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console will be computer workstations and servers. A working version of PlayStation 3 is due to be shown off in May 2005 but a full launch of PlayStation 3 is not expected to start until 2006. ""In the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network,"" said Ken Kutaragi, chief operating officer of Sony's, said last year. ""Current PC architecture is nearing Current PC architecture's limits,"" Ken Kutaragi, chief operating officer of Sony, added.",technologie
technologie_18,"Intel unveils laser breakthrough Intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light. Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. laser breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. The Intel researchers said products exploiting laser breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. ""Scientists at Intel've overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light,"" said Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. Currently, says Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables. Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it because silicon is cheap and many of the problems of using silicon in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. ""Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang -'re trying to take Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang -'s silicon competency in manufacturing and apply our silicon competency in manufacturing to new areas,"" said Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab. While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through silicon, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within silicon. ""some colliding photons creates a cloud of electrons sitting in silicon and a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon absorbs all the light,"" Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab said. But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. Even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy-to-make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process data. Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. ""the work's a technical validation that silicon can work,"" Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab said.",technologie

The revamp has been prompted by Microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. Microsoft The announcement about Internet Explorer a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make Microsoft's current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. Test versions of the new program, called IE 7, are due to be released by the summer. The announcement about its Internet Explorer web browser was made by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco. Although details were scant, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, said a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser would include new protections against viruses, spyware and phishing scams. viruses, spyware and phishing scams involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information. In a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. Earlier this month Microsoft released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in its Internet Explorer web browser. Microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. One of the first fruits of a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security appeared last month with the release of a Microsoft anti-spyware program. An own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. The decision to make a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said Microsoft had no need to update its Internet Explorer web browser. Typically new versions of Microsoft's browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system. A new version of its Internet Explorer web browser was widely expected to debut with the next version of the Windows operating system, codenamed Longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006. The current version of its Internet Explorer web browser is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as Firefox and Opera. There are also persistent rumours that search engine Google is poised to produce search engine Google's own brand browser based on Firefox. In particular Firefox has been winning fans and users since Firefox's first full version was released in November 2004. Estimates of how many users Firefox has won over vary widely. According to market statistics gathered by Websidestory, Firefox's market share is now about 5% of all users. However, other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%.

An Indian telecommunications firm is using lasers to make the link between customers' offices and An Indian telecommunications firm's own core network. The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. In 12 months lasers have helped An Indian telecommunications firm set up networks in more than 700 locations. ""In more than 700 locations getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,"" said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at An Indian telecommunications firm. ""Heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,"" Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata said. In some locations, Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. This has led An Indian telecommunications firm to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between An Indian telecommunications firm's core network and the premises of customers. The laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of its own core network. equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses. The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but An Indian telecommunications firm is running An Indian telecommunications firm's hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. lasers are also ideal for the country because of the country's climate. ""lasers's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy,"" Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata said. In places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata. ""Once An Indian telecommunications firm get the other permissions, normal time period for set up is a few hours,"" Mr R.

Anti-spam group Spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail makes spam look like spam is being sent by legitimate mail servers making spam hard to spot and filter out. Anti-spam group Spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent. Before now many spammers have recruited home PCs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of many spammers's junk mail. home PCs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. Once compromised machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. Anti-spam group Spamhaus helps to block junk messages from machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. But the novel worm spotted recently by Anti-spam group Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. In routes junk gets a net address that looks legitimate. As blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, Anti-spam group Spamhaus is worried that routes will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. Steve Linford, director of Anti-spam group Spamhaus, predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit routes it could trigger the failure of the net's e-mail sending infrastructure. David Stanley, UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust, said routes was the next logical step for spammers. ""spammers are adding to spammers's armoury,"" David Stanley, UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust said. The amount of spam in circulation was still growing, said David Stanley, UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust, but David Stanley, UK managing director of filtering firm Ciphertrust did not think that the appearance of routes would mean e-mail meltdown. But Kevin Hogan, senior manager at Symantec security response, said such warnings were premature. ""If something like routes mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago,"" said Kevin Hogan, senior manager at Symantec security response. While routes might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost other techniques for stopping spam's efficacy too. Kevin Hogan, senior manager at Symantec security response said 90% of the junk mail filtered by Symantec subsidiary Brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses.

In a panel discussion at a Linux summit in California Linux founder Linus Torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. Mitchell Kapor, chairman of the Mozilla foundation, warned that Microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. Linux is a freely-available alternative to Microsoft's Windows. Linux relies on a community of programmers for Linux's development and is based on open source principles, which allow others to use and modify Linux without having to pay licence fees. an attack on software patents comes at a time when IBM has made 500 of IBM's patents freely available. Other companies are expected to follow suit. There are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the US and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. This is a view corroborated by the UK Patent Office. ""Some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that smaller companies can't afford to take licenses to court,"" said Dr Jeremy Philpott of the UK Patent Office. Some panel members are worried that Microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future.

technologie_30,"Solutions to net security fears Fake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts. Trust in online security is falling as a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. a poll reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issues but More people have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out a poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing An estimated 12 million Britons's financial affairs. Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular. ""Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini don't think the threat is overplayed,"" Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini, told the BBC News website. Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini added: ""The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances security with usability."" Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects banks too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure both parties do what is necessary to prevent fraud, Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini said. ""Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that, Card issuers will indemnify us,"" Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini said. Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal more than 70% of people's password for a bar of chocolate. On average, people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several passwords often write several passwords down and hide several passwords in a desk or in a document on Those who use several passwords's computer. In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said 80% were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard. Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA, which has been trying to come up with just that. RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. Activcard's method is more complex. Activcard is currently trailing Activcard's one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who an individual say an individual are when an individual are online. ""The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something the user have and present those both."" The method Activcard has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time changes. Activcard's method combines a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. ""You take the card, put the card in a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time, enter your pin number, and a code is given. ""If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction."" The clever bit happens back at the bank's's secure servers. a code is validated by the bank's's systems, matching the information the bank's expect with the customer's unique key. ""Each individual gets a key which is unique to Each individual. a key which is unique to them is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,"" said Steve Ash, from Activcard. It means that in a typical security attack, explains Steve Ash, from Activcard, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, a scammer need the passcode. ""By the time a scammer go back [to use password information], the code has expired, so a scammer can't prove who a scammer are,"" according to Steve Ash, from Activcard. In the next few years, Steve Ash, from Activcard predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. ""PCs will have readers built into PCs, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards."" The gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in The gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles. ""The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,"" Steve Ash, from Activcard said.",technologie
technologie_31,"Mobile networks seek turbo boost Third-generation mobile (3G) networks need to get faster if Third-generation mobile (3G) networks are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to Fast 3G networks's evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association. At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. Siemens said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks. a system that transmits faster mobile data is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. Early HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now systems typically offer around two megabits per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks. ""HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys. A number of companies are developing HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless aim to jointly market HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now to global network operator customers. ""While HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than a maximum of 14Mbps in wide-area networks,"" said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the UK-based research consultancy Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. ""The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity when compared to basic WCDMA [3G],"" he added. Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker has conducted five trials of Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker's technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO). US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to US operator Sprint's 3G network at the end of last year. US operator Sprint are ""expanding US operator Sprint's network and deploying EV-DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,"" said Oliver Valente, US operator Sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced. As part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, US operator Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4Mbps. MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany, has opted for technology based on the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard. Using technology from Lucent Technologies, MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany will offer data speeds of 3.6Mbps from next summer on MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany's Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4Mbps. US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard, using technology from Lucent Technologies alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson. Siemens's plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at Siemens says that: ""By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. This enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. The speeds offered by3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences. But today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3G. This means users are likely to find 3G disappointing unless broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3G. are souped up. If users aren't, those lucrative ""power users"", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3G. for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. Siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, the system still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. A commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date.",technologie

A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems will issue warnings about damaging viruses, software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. Alerts tell people how damaging viruses, software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones affect people and what people can do to avoid trouble and protect people. A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. The scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. UK estimates UK will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year, based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. ""There is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work,"" said Home Office Minister Hazel Blears. ""The purpose of A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with the risks involved easily and effectively without causing alarm."" Those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people. Full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people Between alerts A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use people's computers and phones. ""A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems will take our technical expertise and use our technical expertise to help home users understand the risks and keep home users's computer systems, mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items, safe,"" said Roger Cumming, director of the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC). The NISCC, which is running A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems, also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software, firewalls, and software updates to stay secure. Warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is, how the problem affects people and what people can do to avoid trouble. Alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect users against the threat. This might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. However no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems. Alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. The the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC) spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets. Government statistics show that more than half of all UK households own a home computer. It was estimated that almost 13 million of more than half of all UK households were able to access internet in 2004. The scheme comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. In September 2004, the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100,000 mark. Some fear that the number of malicious programs circulating could hit 150,000 by September 2005. The creation of alerting service follows similar efforts in the Netherlands and US. The National Alerting Service for Netherlands (aka De Waarschuwingsdienst) and the US National Cyber Alerting Service also tell citizens of serious security threats.",technologie

The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an Hewlett Packard (HP) inkjet printer since February 2001. Hewlett Packard (HP) declined to comment on The lawsuit.

technologie_37,"I tried to delete myself from the internet. Here's what I learned It was MyLife that broke me. After spending hours studying FAQ pages, sending terse emails and making occasional phone calls in an earnest-if-naive attempt to take back some control of my personal information online, I had my first demoralizing moment. MyLife pulls together vast amounts of public data to create background reports and ""reputation scores"" on millions of people in the US, all available to those willing to pay for a monthly membership. On MyLife, I found a sometimes inaccurate but eerie amount of personal information about, well, my life: my birthday and home city; my previous job title (though curiously not my current one); a list of people ""Seth maintains relationships with,"" including the names of both my parents, each linked to both my parents's own profile pages with still more data. All there in one place waiting to be discovered. When I called MyLife, a customer service representative stressed that the information doesn't come from MyLife, but rather from across the ""interwebs."" Following some back and forth, a customer service representative agreed to delete my profile page. I felt victorious -- until two hours later when I received the first of many promotional emails from MyLife, one encouraging me to sign up for a membership, another talking about raising my credit score. As I would learn through my brief, manic campaign in December to scrub as much of my personal data as possible and start the new year with a clean digital slate, it's hard not to feel like you're just scratching the surface of an impossibly large data industrial complex. By the end of my experiment, I felt even worse off about my ability to wrestle back control of my data than when I started. Our data is out there. Now what? n recent years, it's become a truism in certain tech-savvy Twitter threads that much of our personal information is already out there somewhere thanks to an ever-growing list of hacks. Banks, retailers, social networks -- both popular and defunct -- have all disclosed massive data breaches. In 2017 alone, Verizon (VZ) confirmed that every single Yahoo account -- all 3 billion of them -- had been affected by a massive breach and Equifax (EFX) disclosed that a breach had potentially exposed the names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and credit card numbers of as much as nearly half the US. There are only two viable emotional reactions to such a total collapse of personal privacy: denial or helplessness. After trying the former for a time, I shifted to the latter, prompted, as with so many moments in my life, by belatedly listening to a sobering podcast about a hack. I followed the usual measures recommended in informational cybersecurity stories -- implementing two-factor authentication; signing up for a password management app; freezing credit reports indefinitely -- all with an overriding sense that none of these steps eliminated any of that personal information floating around in some dark corner of the internet. As cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier recently put it to one of my colleagues: ""So one of my colleagues's password was stolen, is there any way one of my colleagues can go to every criminal on the planet, to every criminal on the planet's computers, and delete one of my colleagues's name? No."" But there had to be something more to be done, I thought. The fact of the matter is, the internet is already littered with information that could be used against us, much of information that could be used against us collected through entirely legal means. Mothers' maiden names. Birthdays. Home addresses. I might not be able to prevent my favorite stores from getting hacked, or sweet talk a bunch of hackers after the fact, but I could make it just a little bit harder for a bad actor to find my personal information online -- and in the process, regain some sense of control of my data and my life.",technologie

The company, which hopes to keep Apple's dominant place in the growing digital music gadget market, also said the gold coloured version of an iPod mini model which can hold 6GB compared to a previous 4GB would be dropped. A 30GB version has also been added to the iPod Photo family. The latest models have a longer battery life and The latest models's prices have been cut by an average of £40. The original iPod took an early lead in the growing digital music gadget market thanks to The original iPod's large storage capacity and simple design. During last year about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were Apple iPods. But analysts agree that the success is also down to Apple's integration with the iTunes online store, which has given Apple a 70% share of the legal download music market. Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner, told the BBC News website that Apple had done a good job in ""sealing off the growing digital music gadget market from competition"" so far. ""Apple have created a very seamless package which Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner think is the idea of the product - the design, function and the software are very impressive,"" Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner said.

Sales of legally downloaded songs also the growth more than tenfold in last year, according to the record industry, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months. The IFPI industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. Analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players. People are also starting to use portable music players in novel ways. Some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute DIY radio shows, called podcasts. But 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. According to Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which people can do with high-capacity storage devices, like iPods and Creative Zens. Mobiles do not yet have this capacity though, and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner said Apple was ensuring Apple kept a foot in the mobile music door with Apple's recent deal with Motorola to produce a version of iTunes for Motorola phones.",technologie

The pirated DVD market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. copy protection firm Macrovision says copy protection firm Macrovision's new RipGuard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current DVD ripping (copying) programs used to pirate DVDs. ""its new RipGuard technology is designed to reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,"" said copy protection firm Macrovision. copy protection firm Macrovision said its new RipGuard technology will work in ""nearly all"" current DVD players when applied to the discs, but copy protection firm Macrovision did not specify how many machines could have a problem with its new RipGuard technology. its new RipGuard technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales. The film industry has stepped up efforts to fight DVD piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of DVD movies for download. ""Ultimately, copy protection firm Macrovision see its new RipGuard technology evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,"" said Steve Weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of copy protection firm Macrovision's Entertainment Technologies Group. copy protection firm Macrovision said its new RipGuard technology was designed to plug the ""digital hole"" that was created by so-called DeCSS ripper software. its new RipGuard technology circumvents Content Scrambling System measures placed on DVDs and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted DVDs in minutes. perfect digital copies of copyrighted DVDs could then be burned onto a blank DVD or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. copy protection firm Macrovision said its new RipGuard technology would also prevent against ""rent, rip and return"" - where people would rent a DVD, copy a DVD and then return a DVD. its new RipGuard technology is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, copy protection firm Macrovision said. its new RipGuard technology works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, most ripping programs will now most likely crash, copy protection firm Macrovision said. copy protection firm Macrovision has said that its new RipGuard technology can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.",technologie

The EFF, representing three US online journalists, has asked California's Superior court to stop Apple pursuing 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products, including the Mac Mini. Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argues that three US online journalists are protected by the American constitution. Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) says a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple threatens the basic freedoms of the press. Apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked three US online journalists's e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid. ""Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to three US online journalists's ISPs for three US online journalists's e-mails,"" said Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) lawyer Kurt Opsahl. ""This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. ""If California's Superior court lets Apple get away with this, and exposes the confidences gained by three US online journalists, potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news, analysis and commentary,"" EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl said. a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get three US online journalists to reveal three US online journalists's sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org.

A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans. a survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have MP3 players. The American love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband. Of 22 million people, 59% are men compared to 41% of women. Those on high income - judged to be $75,000 (£39,000) or above - are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than $30, 000 ( £15,000). Broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. Almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players, compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access. MP3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 have one. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 compares to 14% of those aged 30-39 and 14% of those aged 40-48. The influence of children also plays a part. Sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to 9% of those who don't.

technologie_48,"Domain system scam fear A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned. A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force. But a trade body is concerned that A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of a trade body. Domain names are the ""real language"" addresses of websites, rather than websites's internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. Domain names are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site the computer code would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious A fake Paypal.com has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF said. ""Although the the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily the commercial world's websites can be faked,"" said Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. ""It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting users to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,"" Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF added. There are solutions. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display domains that use mixed characters in different colours as a warning to users. Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. ""A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,"" CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, said in a statement.",technologie
technologie_49,"Cheaper chip for mobiles A mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful. The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. Currently, rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year. Texas Instruments, said Texas Instruments was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. ""Texas Instruments're going to drive multimedia functions like video and gaming down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share,"" said Doug Rasor, a marketing vice president at Texas Instruments. The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, also uses much less power than conventional chips, said Texas Instruments, which means less strain on mobile battery life. More than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. Texas Instruments is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology, which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. But Texas Instruments faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles. Competition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard. But there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. Earlier in January, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks, known as ""super 3G"", intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services. The first stage of development is to be completed by 2007, but no date has been set for a commercial launch The newly-designed OMAP-Vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference, 3GSM, which takes place in Cannes, France this week.",technologie

technologie_52,"Microsoft launches Microsoft's own search Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of Microsoft's home-grown search engine. its own search takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in November 2003. the finished version of its home-grown search engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries. Microsoft faces challenges establishing Microsoft as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries. Google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when people go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images. But in the last year Google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as Yahoo and Microsoft, and new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx. This renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else. Microsoft is keen to make Microsoft's home-grown search engine a significant rival to Google. To generate Microsoft's corpus of data, Microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update Microsoft's document index every two days - more often than rivals. The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer. For the finished version of its home-grown search engine's direct answer feature, Microsoft is calling on Microsoft's Encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that Microsoft's search engine has been answering specific queries its direct answer feature since April 2003.

Microsoft is also using so-called ""graphic equalisers"" that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. Microsoft said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished version of its home-grown search engine. The test, or beta, version of the finished version of its home-grown search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles. On the finished version of its home-grown search engine's first day many new users keen to try the finished version of its home-grown search engine were greeted with a page that said its own search had been overwhelmed.",technologie

technologie_58,"Mobiles 'not media players yet' Mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing, all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players, say two reports. Despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said Jupiter. A separate study by Gartner has also said real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles is ""unlikely"" in Europe until 2007. Technical issues and standards must be resolved first, said A separate study by Gartner. Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others. Bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life. Fifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing Fifty percent of Europeans's phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. ""Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,"" said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter. ""Mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate operators's brands and support third generation network launches."" Other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable players which can hold up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services. With phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch TV on the move. In the US, services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto people's phones. But, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. Currently, TV-like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several European operators, like Italy's TIM and 3. Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before Mobile TV is widely taken up though, said the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe. Various standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. In Europe, trials in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on people's mobiles 24 hours a day. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation uses 3GP technology, one of the standards for mobile TV. But at the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe. Operators will be working on Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. Handsets also need to be able to work with Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H). TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. Digital video recorders, like Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV people watch. As a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away much more control over what TV they watch. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. A report by analysts InStat/MDR says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.",technologie

In Microsoft's monthly security bulletin, Microsoft flagged up eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. Four other important fixes were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. Many of eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data. One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some Internet Explorer (IE) flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said some IE flaws were known about, and although Microsoft had not seen any attacks exploiting some IE flaws, Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave a critical flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in media player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in Microsoft's software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as ""critical"". Microsoft's latest releases came the week that Microsoft announced Microsoft was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make Microsoft's own security programs.",technologie
technologie_60,"Be careful how you code A new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson. If A new European directive gets A new European directive's way, A new European directive will conclude A new European directive's presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the European Parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of European citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against millions of European citizens. If A new European directive was about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our TV screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. Sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess Middle Britain. After all, how much fuss can you generate about A new European directive, and the way A new European directive amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention? Yet if A new European directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the European Union's ministerial councils, as seems likely, A new European directive will allow programs to be patented in Europe just as programs are in the US. Many observers of the computing scene, including former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. A new European directive will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas's competitors' use of really obvious ideas. In the US you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that customer credit card details can pay without having to re-enter customer credit card details unless Amazon lets you, because Amazon hold the patent on ""one-click"" online purchase. It is a small invention, but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it. We are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. The new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the Council of Ministers, radically modified by the European Parliament and then re-presented in proposals's original form. Some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. Poland has rejected the proposal and Germany's main political parties have opposed the proposal, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee Germany's main political parties's rejection. Early in December the British government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on The new proposals. Science Minister Lord Sainsbury went along to listen and outline the UK position, but according to those present, it was embarrassing to see how little Science Minister Lord Sainsbury and Science Minister Lord Sainsbury's officials actually understood the issues concerned. A new European directive is being put through the council as what is called an ""A"" item and can only be approved or rejected. No discussion or amendment is allowed. So why should we be worried? First, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the European Parliament and abandoning all of the European Parliament's carefully argued amendments. This goes to the heart of the European project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. If coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow? More directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code any programmer are writing is infringing someone else's patent. This is not about stealing software, as code is already protected by copyright. Patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. A patent gives the owner the right to stop the other person using the owner's invention, even if the other person invented their invention separately. former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson have never, to former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson's shame, managed to read Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. If it was pointed out that one of former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson's articles contained a substantial chunk of Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage then former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson could defend former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson in court by claiming that former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson had simply made a substantial chunk of the poem up and it was coincidence. The same does not hold for a patent. If former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and a brilliant graphics compression routine happens to be the same as the LZW algorithm used in GIF files, then former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson am in trouble under patent law, at least in the US. Coincidence is no defence. A new European directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of the major software companies are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. They have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders. Even this system breaks down, of course, as Microsoft found out last year when Microsoft initially lost a case brought by Eolas which claimed that Internet Explorer (and other browsers) infringed an Eolas patent. a case brought by Eolas which claimed that Internet Explorer (and other browsers) infringed an Eolas patent was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. But small companies, and the free and open source software movement do not have any patents to trade. Much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the Apache web server, the GNU/Linux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. The damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. If A new European directive goes through A new European directive has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. Eventually someone will decide to attack Linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. A new European directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. And A new European directive will damage Europe's computer industry. We can only hope that the Council of Ministers has the integrity and strength to reject A new European directive. former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",technologie

Ask Jeeves said Ask Jeeves was not planning to change the Bloglines website but would use the 300 million articles Ask Jeeves has archived to round out Ask Jeeves's index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for the Bloglines website was not revealed. the Bloglines website has become popular because the Bloglines website lets users build a list of the blogs users want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this Ask Jeeves makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on other sites's journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced MSN's own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked Yahoo's technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said Ask Jeeves did not acquire the Bloglines website just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information people were looking for rather than helping people write information they were looking for. ""The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,"" Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US said. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US said The acquisition would sit well with Ask Jeeves's My Jeeves service which lets people customise people's own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. ""Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor information,"" Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US said. RSS would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to the Bloglines website, said Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US. ""Ask Jeeves's intent is to take Ask Jeeves's time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise the Bloglines website right away,"" Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US said. Though Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries the Bloglines website holds with the Bloglines website's own net indexing technology.

technologie_62,"Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says Digital guru is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53). Digital guru told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital Digital guru hoped a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) would become an education tool in developing countries. Digital guru said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood"". Digital guru said the child could use a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) like a text book. Digital guru described a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, ""MIT's Media Labs have to get the display down to below $20, to do this MIT's Media Labs need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. ""The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny the fat down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53) will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Digital guru said this was a not for profit venture, though Digital guru recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Digital guru published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do children's work on. While The concept was popular amongst the children, The concept initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Digital guru has adapted The concept to Digital guru's own work in Cambodia where Digital guru set up two schools together with Digital guru's wife and gave the children laptops. ""We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the children cherish 25 laptops, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook."" Digital guru wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. ""Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."" Digital guru plans to be distributing the laptops by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. ""In China the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. $17 per child per year's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.""",technologie
technologie_63,"Looks and music to drive mobiles Mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts Gartner. More than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said research from technology analysts Gartner, the highest total sold to date. More than 674 million mobiles was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, technology analysts Gartner said. Good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in last year, said analysts. Although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to technology analysts Gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales. ""All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe,"" mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website. ""Japan is where north America and western European markets can be in a couple of years' time. ""north America and western European markets already have TV, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones."" But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too, according to technology analysts Gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what mobile companies are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said technology analysts Gartner. Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading people's phones, but mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. ""At the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical."" Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones's own. The majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where camera phone models can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms. More likely to drive sales in last year would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. The Motorola Razr V3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in last year, mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi added. This was not a ""women's thing"", mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. It was not just about how The Motorola Razr V3 phone functioned, but about what The Motorola Razr V3 phone said about The Motorola Razr V3 phone's owner. ""western Europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design,"" said mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi. ""People are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. ""This year music will have a part to play in this."" The market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004, but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£9.4 million) by 2009, according to Jupiter Research. Sony Ericsson just released Sony Ericsson's Walkman branded mobile phone, the W800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera. In July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones. Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorola's standard music application for Motorola's music phones. But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod. mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. But more models would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity, which would not put too much strain on battery life.",technologie

Yahoo has undergone remarkable change since Yahoo was set up by Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang in a campus trailer. Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang wanted a way of keeping track of Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang's web-based interests. The categories lists Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang saw business potential in Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang's idea. Originally dubbed ""Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web"" Yahoo adopted the moniker Yahoo because Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude, unsophisticated, uncouth person. the moniker Yahoo was popularised by the 18th Century satirist Jonathan Swift in the 18th Century satirist Jonathan Swift's classic novel, Gulliver's Travels. ""Yahoo were certainly not sophisticated or civilised,"" Jerry Yang told reporters ahead of its 10th anniversary. Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang did have business brains however, and in April 1995 persuaded venture capitalists Sequoia Capital, which also invested in Apple Computer and Cisco Systems, to fund Yahoo to the tune of $2m (£1.04m). A second round of funding followed in the autumn and Yahoo floated in April 1996 with less than 50 employees. Now Yahoo employs 7,600 workers and insists Yahoo's dot com culture of ""work hard, play hard"" still remains. Yahoo is one of just a handful of survivors of the dot-com crash although Yahoo now faces intense rivalry from firms such as Google, MSN and AOL. Jerry Yang, who remains Yahoo's ""Chief Yahoo"", is proud of what Yahoo has achieved. ""In just one decade, the net's has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and the net's's been a remarkable and wonderful experience,"" Jerry Yang said. Through it all, Yahoo wanted to build products that satisfied Yahoo's users wants and needs, but it's even more than that - it's to help every one of Yahoo to discover, get more done, share and interact.""",technologie

technologie_66,"Tough rules for ringtone sellers Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks. Tough rules for ringtone sellers allow offenders to be cut off if offenders do not let consumers know exactly what consumers get for consumers's money and how to turn off ringtones and other mobile extras. The first month under Tough rules for ringtone sellers has seen at least ten firms suspended while at least ten firms clean up the way at least ten firms work. Tough rules for ringtone sellers have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. In the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get firms's wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone. ""If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,"" Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. a new tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give people, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track people thought people were getting. Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for did not know customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for had signed up for. ""What made Vodafone uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,"" said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone. ""People did not know People were being offered a subscription service."" ""Vodafone saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,"" Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone added. The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of Tough rules for ringtone sellers was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. ""Everyone is required to conform to a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones,"" said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the Mobile Entertainment Forum and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox. ""It's all about transparency,"" Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox said. ""Consumers have to be told what Consumers have got Consumers into and how to get out of it."" ""The consumer has a right to be protected,"" Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. ""Tough rules for ringtone sellers must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,"" Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed said. Tough rules for ringtone sellers came in to force on 15 January and the first month under Tough rules for ringtone sellers has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring Tough rules for ringtone sellers. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what customers get for customers's money and what customers are signing up for, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone. Also, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting Tough rules for ringtone sellers. ""Vodafone have quite draconian contracts with firms,"" Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone said. ""Vodafone do not have to say why. Vodafone can just cut between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules off."" Under Tough rules for ringtone sellers consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal ""stop"" command sent via text message. Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if a consumer inadvertently signed up for a service. ""The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of people's personality,"" said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone.",technologie
technologie_67,"Creator of first Apple Mac dies Jef Raskin, head of the team behind first Apple Mac, has died. Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made first Apple Mac so distinctive when first Apple Mac was first released. Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around first Apple Mac by pointing and clicking. The 1984 release of first Apple Mac reflected Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer's belief that good design should make computers easy to use. Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead Apple's publications department. However, in 1979 Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer was put in charge of the team behind the first Macintosh computer to design a computer that lived up to Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer's idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. The result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. Users navigated around a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. Although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in first Apple Mac. The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC, and used in Xerox PARC's Star machine. But the acceptance of The GUI did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in Apple's pioneering Lisa computer. ""Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer's role on first Apple Mac was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer,"" said Andy Hertzfeld, an early first Apple Mac team member. Although Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer drove the team that created first Apple Mac Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer did not stay at Apple to see first Apple Mac released. In 1981 Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer was removed from the project following a dispute with Apple's mercurial boss Steve Jobs. In 1982, Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer left Apple entirely. first Apple Mac was reputedly the name after Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. After leaving Apple, Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society. Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer's home in California.",technologie

More than 50% of mobile owners reported More than 50% of mobile owners had had More than 50% of mobile owners's phone stolen or lost in the last three years. More than half (54%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that More than half (54%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice do not have another address book. A fifth rely entirely on mobiles. About 80% of UK adults own at least one mobile, according to official figures. It is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile, according to mobile firm Intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34. Most 15 to 24-year-olds (94%), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92%), own at least one. Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find Nineteen percent of mobile owners's contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced. a poll for mobile firm Intervoice showed that extent to which people have become reliant on people's phones as address book. Many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of Many mobile owners's contact details, and with people changing people's phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem. Many mobile owners also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead. ""We're a nation of lazy so-and-sos,"" David Noone from mobile firm Intervoice said. ""We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write the numbers down in an old fashioned address book. ""The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage modern relationships falls apart."" One in three women, a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said, thought if One in three women lost One in three women's phones, it would mean One in three women would lose touch with people altogether. Most (62%) said Most (62%) had no idea what Most (62%)'s partner's number was. David Noone from Intervoice said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways mobile owners. Generally, information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. Sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds. But some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. mobile firm Intervoice told the BBC News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. For non-smartphone users, a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. O2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM. Neither Vodafone or T-Mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups, but encourage people to use Sim back-up devices. It is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile. Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. Globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26% more than the previous year, according to analysts. It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.",technologie

When iPhone X first debuted in 2017, iPhone X made headlines for several reasons. iPhone X was the first iPhone to have Face ID, the first to have an OLED display and the first to have an on-screen notch. At the time iPhone X was a top-of-the-class device. Now, three years later, iPhone X's just as reliable. Though Apple discontinued iPhone X a mere 10 months after iPhone X's launch, Apple sells refurbished models at a heavy discount: $599 or £599 (64GB) and $699 or £699 (256GB).

More than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. As well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic, organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) warned that people should ""stay alert"". ""Many online consumers don't consider the true motives of spammers,"" said Mike Newton, a spokesperson for the BSA which commissioned a report. ""By selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites, spammers are hiding spyware without consumers' knowledge. ""Once software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites is installed on PCs and networks, information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused."" The results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10. The research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and 6,000 people in six countries's attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that Brazilians were the most likely to read spam. A third of Brazilians read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam. The French were the second most likely to buy something (48%), with 44% of Britons taking advantage of products and services. This was despite 38% of people in six countries being worried about 38% of people in all countries's net security because of the amount of spam 38% of people in all countries get. More than a third of respondents said More than a third of respondents were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information. ""Both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail, helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites,"" said William Plante, director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm Symantec. ""At the same time, consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect consumers from harm with a mixture of spam filters, spyware detection software and sound judgement.""",technologie
technologie_71,"Gadget growth fuels eco concerns Technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for several hi-tech firms's strategies to help the environment. Ebay also announced the Rethink project bringing together Intel, Apple, and IBM among others to promote recycling. The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. But more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices, one of the fastest growing markets in technology. The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly £68 billion). Ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and Ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send old computers. Ebay thinks that Ebay's already-established community of loyal users could be influential. ""Ebay really became aware of the e-waste issue and Ebay saw that Ebay's 125 million users can be a powerful force for good,"" Ebay's David Stern told the BBC News website. ""Ebay saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand Ebay have on Ebay for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment."" But it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. Teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months, adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. Yet, only 15% are actually recycled. This year, a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile, according to a Deloitte report. Schemes in the US, like RIPMobile, could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. The initiative, which was also launched at CES, This system 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones. ""This system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games,"" said Seth Heine from RIPMobile. One group of students collected 1,000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. Seth Heine from RIPMobile told the BBC News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes ""learned behaviour"". Europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the US in terms of recycling awareness and robust ""end of life"" programmes, although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. Intel showcased some Intel's motherboards and chips at CES which are entirely lead free. ""There is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free,"" Intel's Allen Wilson told the BBC News website. ""There is still low-level awareness right now, but low-level awareness is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in Europe."" A European Union (EU) directive, WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment), comes into effect in August. A European Union (EU) directive, WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment) puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to electrical manufacturers. But developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. Elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in European Union (EU) by 2006. But it is not just about recycling either. The predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power the gadget market up is on the rise too. The biggest culprit, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed ""energy vampires"". the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed ""energy vampires"" provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), digital cameras, camcorders, and digital music players. Although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed ""energy vampires"", the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. On 1 January, new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the European Commission Code of Conduct. But at CES, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also unveiled new guidelines for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters. new guidelines for its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an Energy Star logo, meaning better adaptors that can be labelled with an Energy Star logo, meaning they are about 35% more efficient are about 35% more efficient. its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters is a global effort and more manufacturers' adaptors are being brought on board. Most are made in China. About two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the US. the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market. ""the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with neat, hi-tech devices a hi-tech, efficient power supply,"" the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Andrew Fanara said. Initiatives like its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as power adaptors are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in US homes, said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",technologie
technologie_72,"'Evil twin' fear for wireless net People using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots, or access points. The latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say Cranfield University experts. Once logged onto an Evil Twin, sensitive data can be intercepted. Wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. London leads the global wi-fi hotspots league, with more than 1,000. The number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008, according to analysts. ""Users need to be wary of using Users's wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature,"" said Professor Brian Collins, head of information systems at Cranfield University. ""Users can also protect Users by ensuring that Users's wi-fi device has their wi-fi device's security measures activated,"" Professor Brian Collins, head of information systems at Cranfield University added. BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK, told the BBC News website that BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK made every effort to make BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK's wi-fi secure. ""Naturally, people may have security concerns,"" said Chris Clark, chief executive for BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK's wireless broadband. ""But wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet, like broadband or dial-up."" Chris Clark, chief executive for BT's wireless broadband said BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. ""This means that users' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure,"" said Chris Clark, chief executive for BT's wireless broadband. In the vast majority of cases, base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible, said Dr Nobles. Cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam, jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. Anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute a real hotspot with an evil twin. ""Cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack,"" said Dr Phil Nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield University. ""Because wireless networks are based on radio signals wireless networks can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency."" Although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure wi-fi is. Some companies have been reluctant to use wi-fi in large numbers because of fears about security. A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. Public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like BT Openzone and The Cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. But many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be ""sniffed out"" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. ""BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK advises that customers should change all default settings, make sure that customers's security settings on all equipment are configured correctly,"" said Chris Clark, chief executive for BT's wireless broadband. ""BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted.""

technologie_73,"New consoles promise big problems Making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money, an industry conference has been told. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will debut Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo's new consoles at the annual E3 games Expo in Los Angeles in May. New consoles will be faster than current consoles, and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. For gamers, this should make for better, more immersive games. In a pre-recorded video slot during Microsoft's keynote address at the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco, famed director James Cameron revealed famed director James Cameron is making a game in tandem with famed director James Cameron's next film - believed to be Battle Angel Alita. a game's visual quality would be ""like a lucid dream,"" said famed director James Cameron. But numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. The first new console, Microsoft's Xbox 2, is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. Games typically take at least 18 months to create, however, so developers are grappling with the hardware today. According to Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios, next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. Such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio, said Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios. ""If you're a start-up, Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m, however good you are,"" Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios said. Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS, since games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS are cheaper and easier to create than console games. One developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games. The founder of California's Maxis studio surprised the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco with a world exclusive preview of The founder of California's Maxis studio's next game, Spore. his next game, Spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. Starting with an amoeba-sized organism, the player will guide the physical development of the player's creature by selecting how an amoeba-sized organism's limbs, jaws and other body parts evolve. Eventually an amoeba-sized organism will become capable of establishing cities, trading and fighting, and even building space ships. Advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other his next game, Spore players. the home planets of creatures created by other Spore players will be automatically swapped across the Internet. Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games said that enabling players to devise and share players's creatures would make players care more about the game. ""Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games don't want to put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins - Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games want the player to be George Lucas or Dr Seuss,"" explained Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games. Few games have hinted at the scope of his next game, Spore, but Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games explained that Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games has nevertheless kept Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games's development team small by hiring expert programmers. Instead of employing lots of artists to create 3D models of the digital creatures, his next game, Spore generates and displays the digital creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. ""The thing Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games am coming away with [from the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating next generation content will drive the smaller players out of the market,"" said Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games. ""Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games'd like to offer an alternative to that."" New development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games, and dozens of companies demonstrated dozens of companies's latest products at the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco. Oxford-based Natural Motion launched Endorphin v2.0, which enables artists to direct a 3D 'virtual actor'. a 3D 'virtual actor' is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. Endorphin v2.0, which enables artists to direct a 3D 'virtual actor' simulates how the actor falls down stairs, for instance, or crumples up after a gunshot. Artists can blend together these visual sequences, and include the results in Artists's games. The process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand, and so lessens the need for larger art teams. Another British company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is Manchester start-up Genemation. Manchester start-up Genemation's latest tool, GenCrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. Its latest tool, GenCrowd, works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. Its latest tool, GenCrowd, can create up to 2,000 new heads an hour. One area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. Even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for Even the latest phones. the Game Developers Conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. A niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games began five years ago, the Game Developers Conference's Mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. Mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games. Furthermore, the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. It's predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. The growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile. EA Mobile is a division of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher. Until recently Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher had been dismissive of games for phones. ""The last time you checked, Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher wasn't in this business,"" John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile admitted. But John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile said Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher's most popular franchises. Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. The first will be a version of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher's Need for Speed racing game, created by EA Mobile's 30-person development team. John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile predicted that by 2006, mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on Sony's upcoming PSP handheld console.

technologie_76,"Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves Viruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change. a subtle change is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help tech savvy criminals con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home PCs. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code. The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method viruses use to spread and how viruses infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package. ""You cannot put many of the viruses written by criminals in to the neat little box that you used to,"" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by viruses like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. ""It's about outright criminality now,"" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift, explaining why a subtle change has come about. Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka, aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because the malware scene was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off virus writers's technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. ""In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,"" Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. ""If you think of criminals criminals do not do clever,"" said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, ""criminals just do what works."" As the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, so many firms were changing the way so many firms defend so many firms. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure machines that connect to the corporate networks have not been compromised while off the core network. Many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with a worker's job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. ""The main motivation now is money,"" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what criminals recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because So-called spyware allowed criminals to take over machines for criminals's own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs spyware infects and then trying to erase rival malicious programs so spyware has sole ownership of PCs it infects.",technologie

""This year is where Internet TV starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in South America, and other parts of Asia, Internet TV will expand,"" Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV added. What telcos really want to do is to send the ""triple-play"" of video, voice, and data down one single line, be it cable or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line). Some are talking about ""quadruple play"", too, with mobile services added into the mix. It is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. According to technology analysts, TDG Research, there will be 20 million subscribers to IPTV services in under six years. Key to the appeal of sending TV programmes down the same line as the web data, whenever a viewer wants TV programmes, is that TV programmes uses the same technology as the internet. It means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the ""broadcaster"". This allows for more DVD-like interactivity, limitless storage and broadcast space, bespoke channel ""playlists"", and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer's fingertips. It potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller, niche or localised audiences, sending films to Bollywood fans for instance, as well as individual devices. Operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer, bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. Perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. Currently, there is a delay when you try to do instantaneous channel flicking on satellite, cable or Freeview. With IPTV - Internet Protocol TV -, the speed is 15 milliseconds. ""That gets rounds of applause,"" according to Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV. Software giant Microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about IPTV some time ago. ""Software giant Microsoft believe IPTV will be the way all TV is delivered in the future - but that is several years away,"" said Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV. ""As with music, TV has moved to digital formats. ""The things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the TV, to the mobile, to the gaming console and so on."" Software giant Microsoft intends Software giant Microsoft's Microsoft's IPTV Edition software, an end-to-end management and delivery platform, to let telcos to do exactly that, seamlessly. Software giant Microsoft has netted seven major telcos as customers, representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers. Software giant Microsoft's deal with US telco SBC was the largest TV software deal to date, said Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV. IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - is about more than telcos, though. There are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net's power. Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, told the BBC News website that it would be a flavour of IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - that was about harnessing the web as a ""channel"". ""It is not just niches, but about exploiting content not usually viewed,"" Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, said. ""Brightcove are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content, and who often see unencumbered distribution. ""For the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content, and who often see unencumbered distribution to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive,"" Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, said. This type of IPTV service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance. What is a clear sign that IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - has a future is that Software giant Microsoft is not the only player in the field. There are a lot of other ""middleware"" players providing similar management services as Microsoft, like Myrio and C-Cor. But it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.",technologie

Worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. The developers behind Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing claim Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. But privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software. Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software. security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity, store computer activity and retrieve disputed files within minutes. More and more firms are finding More and more firms in deep water as a result of data misuse. Sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) A survey conducted on the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU's behalf by NOP found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. storage specialists BridgeHead Software has come up with techniques to prove, to a legal standard, that any stored file on a PC has not been tampered with. Ironically the impetus for developing Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Potentially Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether stolen files had been emailed to a third party, copied, printed, deleted or saved to CD, floppy disk, memory stick or flash card. Other activities Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing can monitor include the downloading of pornography, the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. Increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data, such as governments, are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and employers's staff. ""That is not the case,"" said Tim Ellsmore, managing director of security firm 3ami. ""It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof,"" Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami said. ""People need to recognise that you are using a PC as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data,"" Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami added.",technologie
technologie_79,"New delay hits EU software laws New delay has hit controversial new EU rules which govern computer-based inventions. The draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which The draft law was supposed to have been discussed. New delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about The draft law for the second time in two months. Critics say The draft law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. ""There was at one point the intention to put The draft law on today's agenda. But in the end EU could not put The draft law on,"" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. an EU spokesman added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of The draft law. In December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because Poland was concerned that The draft law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Poland's ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so Poland's backing for The draft law is vital. EU says The draft law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for the US-based Amazon.com's ""one-click shopping"" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which big companies have spent years developing.",technologie

The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what 87% of searchers were looking for when using a search engine. a report into search habits also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. a report into search habits reveals that 84% of net users say 84% of net users regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN and Yahoo when online. Almost 50% of those questioned said Almost 50% of those questioned would trust search engines much less, if Almost 50% of those questioned knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. According to figures gathered by the the US Pew Research Center researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. For 44% of those questioned, the information 44% of those questioned are looking for is critical to what 44% of those questioned are doing and is information 44% of those questioned simply have to find. Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once Search engine users have found a site Search engine users feel Search engine users can trust tend to stick with a site they feel they can trust. According to the US Pew Research Center 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the results reflected Ask Jeeves's own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way different search engines gather information means different search engines can provide different results for the same query. Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said half of those questioned could get the same information via other routes. A small number, 17%, said A small number, 17%, wouldn't really miss search engines if search engines did not exist. The remaining 33% said The remaining 33% could not live without search sites. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, thought that the results More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net.

Of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results 62% see when 62% carry out a search. Only 18% of all searchers say Only 18% of all searchers can tell which results are paid for and which are not.

Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said that more UK firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles. Three leading UK video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as more firms struggled to adapt. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months. Microsoft has said repeatedly that Microsoft wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that Xbox 2 will be released in the US before the end of 2005. new consoles will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games. Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said: ""In the last four years Tiga, which represents independent developers have probably lost a third of independent developers."" Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close. ""Once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities,"" Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said. Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of new consoles. That figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the BBC News website - Codemasters, Climax and Rebellion. ""As consoles get more powerful, the content gets more detailed and that means more cost,"" said Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters. Jason Kingsley, chief executive of Rebellion, said the transition from the current generation of consoles to new consoles was difficult because ""the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger"". Jason Kingsley, chief executive of Rebellion, added: ""Rebellion have been through five technology transitions and survived so far. ""Each one has involved the death of some people. Three leading UK video game companies said Three leading UK video game companies were investing in new tools - called middleware - in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control.

technologie_82,"Microsoft makes anti-piracy move Microsoft says Microsoft is clamping down on people running pirated versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system by restricting people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system's access to security features. The Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove people's software is genuine from mid-2005. The Windows Genuine Advantage scheme will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but those with unauthorised copies's options would be ""limited"". Microsoft releases regular security updates to Microsoft's software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated its Windows operating system programs would not have access to other downloads and ""add-ons"" that Microsoft offers. People who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on People who try to manually download security patches's computer or give an identification number. Microsoft's regular patches which Microsoft releases for newly-found security flaws are important because Microsoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. ""It sounds like Microsoft's decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of its Windows operating system is good news for everyone who uses the net,"" Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos said. The Windows Genuine Advantage scheme was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of its Windows operating system. Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because its Windows operating system is so widespread and virus writers are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. Microsoft is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost Microsoft billions, Microsoft says. Microsoft announced earlier in January that Microsoft was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year Microsoft introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of its Windows operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of its Windows operating system with legal ones for free. Microsoft is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies its Windows operating system. ""China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,"" said Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos.",technologie

The portable games machine, which features touch-screen control, will retail for £99 in the UK (149 euros). Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from £19 to £29. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since DS first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said Rival Sony will launch Rival Sony's first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before Euro date. its first handheld console, the PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Rival Sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers. The 15 games available on Euro date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS. More than 120 games are in development for Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS, Nintendo has said. Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the Game Boy Advance's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS, with a ""download play"" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS to play music and video on the move. The launch price of £99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. ""The launch price of £99 (149 euros)'s a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,"" John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine says. ""However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example."" John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine believes that there is likely to be an audience for both Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS and Rival Sony's new PSP, with Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS aimed largely at a younger audience and Sony's new PSP expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. ""Sony's new PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Rival Sony's attitude to Sony's new PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,"" John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest. In the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said Nintendo was ""pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch"". ""Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo,"" Nintendo president Satoru Iwata added.

technologie_84,"Smart search lets art fans browse If you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. ArtGarden, developed by BT's's research unit, is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing the Tate's online collection of paintings. Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures. Clicking on users's favourite will change the gallery in front of users to a selection of similar works. new search technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. new search technology 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with paintings. So, for instance a Whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and Whistler associated to a Whistler painting of a bridge but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement, 19th century and water. A variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. ""It is much more akin to wandering through the gallery,"" said Jemima Rellie, head of the Tate's digital programme. For Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. ""Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project went to an online clothes store to find something to buy Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project's wife for Christmas but Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project didn't have a clue what Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project wanted,"" Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project said. The text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer, neither of which Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project found helpful. Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project ended up doing Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project's present shopping on the high street instead. Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. Similarly, with art, browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. ""You don't arrive at the Tate and tell people what you want to see. One of the skills of showing off its online collection of paintings is to introduce people to things people wouldn't have asked for,"" Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project said. the Tate is committed to making the Tate's art more accessible and technology such as new search technology can help with that, said Jemima Rellie, head of the Tate's digital programme. Jemima Rellie, head of the Tate's digital programme hopes new search technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. BT's research is looking at extending new search technology to other searching, such as for music and films.",technologie
technologie_85,"Warning over Windows Word files Writing a Windows Word document can be a dangerous business, according to document security firm Workshare. Up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed, a survey by document security firm Workshare revealed. To make matters worse 90% of most firms had no idea that confidential information was leaking. The report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding. Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned The report. ""The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too,"" Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research said. The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Windows Word because of the way Windows Word maintains hidden records about editing changes. As documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds the sensitive information's way into documents. Poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. Microsoft, however, does provide an add-on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem. ""an add-on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your Microsoft Office application,"" says the instructions on Microsoft's website. Microsoft recommends that an add-on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem is used before people publish any Windows Word document. A tool for Apple machines running Windows Word is not available. document security firm Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that, on average, 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. Often, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research, legally sensitive information was invisible because legally sensitive information got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared. However, the way that Windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through can be reconstructed. The discovery of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through could prove embarrassing for companies if, for instance, those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. The report revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as, on average, only 40% of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft. Problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research.",technologie

Content on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of watchdog Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for watchdog Ofcom. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by watchdog Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At a debate in Westminster, Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, did not rule out the possibility of regulation. ""The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing consumers to assess the risks consumers,"" Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion. Some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and broadband opens the door to TV content delivered over the internet. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. Head of an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. ""How risque can Head of the division, Andrew Burke be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely Head of the division, Andrew Burke can push it to the limit,"" Head of the division, Andrew Burke said. In fact, Head of the division, Andrew Burke said, if content has been requested by consumers and consumers have gone to lengths to download content, then maybe content should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long This defence no responsibility for the content Internet service providers carry on Internet service providers's servers since the Law Commission dubbed Internet service providers ""mere conduits"" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if Internet service providers have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove illegal content. The level of responsibility Internet service providers have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the internet. the BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said. One of a whole new set of questions will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali,. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of ""impossible to regulate"" and ""just apply offline laws online"". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. ""If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled content up rather than had pushed to consumers, then it is consumers's choice to watch content. There is no watershed on the internet,"" said Head of the division, Andrew Burke.",technologie

technologie_88,"Latest Opera browser gets vocal Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be ""the most accessible browser on the market"", according to Latest Opera browser's authors. Latest Opera browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Latest Opera browser can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create ""style sheets"", Latest Opera browser's developers say. This will enable users to view pages with colours and fonts that users prefer. But Latest Opera browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so Latest Opera browser's accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. ""Opera's mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,"" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. ""So Opera would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users."" Another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. Opera points out that the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling will also appeal to anyone using Latest Opera browser with a handheld device. Opera says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. ""Opera's idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,"" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. ""People are not always in a situation where People can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience."" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Latest Opera browser does not have to be ""trained"" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Latest Opera browser is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Latest Opera browser began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Latest Opera browser's browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",technologie

Imagine a new one. Quick, come with me in my video game time machine! The year is 2012. It's a different world here. Obama is the president. The Olympics were in London. Nintendo just released Nintendo's newest handheld, the 3DS, a year ago. The Nintendo Wii is around, but losing steam with the Wii U around the corner. It's still the era of the PS3 and Xbox 360; the PS4 and Xbox One are a year away. And a little Sony's gaming handheld with a big screen had just arrived.

technologie_92,"The future in your pocket If you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like the next 12 months are going to be a lot of fun. The relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of the hi-tech world's sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. To begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3G) mobile phones become inescapable. The 3 network launched in 2003, Vodafone launched Vodafone's consumer service in November, Orange followed in early December and T-Mobile and O2 are due to launch in 2005. The main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. Already the extra capacity in 3G networks lets The 3 network offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. But the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of operators's revenue. ""Show Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel an operator that believes an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them's voice business can sustain an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel'll write an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them's obituary"" said Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel. Instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3G phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. But 3G will not have everything 3G's own way. 3G will face competition from emerging technologies such as Wimax. Wimax can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. Kent is likely to be the site of the UK's's first Wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and the UK's first Wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. Analyst firm Telecom View predicts that Wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3G and will be a clear winner. Bob Larribeau, principal analyst at Analyst firm Telecom View, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of 3G networks. And the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. wi-fi is popping up in more places than ever and wi-fi's wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers. Moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too. For a start, BT looks set to roll out BT's Bluephone project during the next 12 months. its Bluephone project revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. Fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip). a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip) routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. Anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the UK's's net using population, can use a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip) and could slash Anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the UK's net using population's monthly phone bills if Anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the UK's net using population used a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip). Telecommunications regulator Ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip) calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip) call services starting up. Home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. If 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. Some of storage media will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. Convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. The only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as consumers are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.",technologie
technologie_93,"2021 Acura TLX vs. Audi A4, BMW 330i, Mercedes C300, Volvo S60: How these AWD sedans stack up The battle of the premium all-wheel drive sedans heats up with the debut of Acura's updated TLX. The Acura TLX certainly has Acura TLX's fans, but over the years Acura TLX (and Acura TLX's predecessors) have struggled for legitimacy against the established premium European competition. Acura TLX aims to change that with sharp physicality and a promising pair of turbocharged engine options. Let's see how Acura's new sport sedan stacks up against the established premium European competition. The usual suspects are here: Audi's newly announced 2021 A4, BMW 330i, Mercedes C300 and we're also including Volvo S60. Like Audi and Volvo S60, Acura TLX features standard front-wheel drive; the Bimmer and Benz send the Bimmer and Benz's power to the rear. All five sedans are available with optional all-wheel-drive, so we'll be looking at those configurations to level the playing field. Powertrain The upcoming TLX Type S is certainly exciting with The upcoming TLX Type S's 3.0-liter turbo V6, but Acura hasn't yet announced details or specs for The upcoming TLX Type S, so we'll have to circle back on its 3.0-liter turbo V6 later. For now, let's focus on the standard powertrain: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. the standard powertrain: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission is the same VTEC turbo engine found in Acura's RDX crossover, with 272 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque. In this presumably lighter chassis, it should feel more responsive. Acura TLX claims ""the highest horsepower in Acura TLX's core competitive set,"" according to Acura, and technically that's true. The A4, 3 Series and Mercedes C300 are all members of the around-250-horsepower club. However, for this all-wheel-drive comparison, we have to look at the Volvo S60 T6 AWD which -- with the Volvo S60 T6 AWD which -- with its supercharged and turbocharged engine -- raises the bar to 316 ponies's supercharged and turbocharged engine -- raises the bar to 316 ponies. If you're feeling the need for speed, maybe check out the Swede. Acura has not stated fuel economy estimates for Acura TLX, but we can make an educated guess based on Acura's RDX crossover's numbers. Acura TLX is good for 21 city, 27 highway and 23 combined miles per gallon. In Acura TLX's presumably lighter chassis, we should expect slightly better numbers. Acura TLX'll need slightly better numbers to ascend from Acura TLX's previous spot near the bottom of the pile. Volvo S60, the most powerful of the bunch, is (for now) the least efficient competitor with 21 city mpg, 32 highway mpg and 25 mpg combined -- still better than Acura TLX. Slightly better is the Mercedes-Benz C300 at 26 combined mpg. Audi hasn't released numbers for Audi's 2021 A4, but we don't think its 2021 A4'll be too far off of the 2020 model's 27 combined mpg. The current king of the hill is the BMW 330i xDrive at 25 city, 34 highway and 28 combined mpg. Frankly, we don't think Acura will beat the BMW 330i xDrive at 25 city, 34 highway and 28 combined mpg, but if Acura TLX manages to land in the middle of the pack, Acura TLX'll still be a solid step up over last year. Acura TLX's new look -- based on the Type S concept -- is wrapped around a new platform that is longer and wider than before. The wheelbase also stretches to 113.0 inches, a gain of 3.7 inches. Interestingly, the roof sits 0.6-inch lower (56.4) than last year, which contributes to the wide and low look. Acura TLX is now the longest model in this roundup, measuring over 7 inches longer than the next longest Audi A4 and over 10 inches longer than the C-Class. Acura's 113-inch wheelbase is also one of the longest in the C-Class. Acura's TLX has long straddled the size spectrum between these compact sedans and these compact sedans's midsize counterparts. With 13.5 cubic feet of trunk space, Acura TLX lands right in the middle of the pack. BMW has the biggest boot in the bunch at 17 cubic feet, while Volvo S60 drivers make do with just 11.6 cubes. Interestingly, Volvo S60 is the broadest sedan at 80.3 inches -- about 5 inches wider than Acura -- if wide bois are a thing you're into.",technologie
technologie_94,"Mobile games come of age The BBC News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. If you think of Snake when some mentions ""mobile games"" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on many mobile operators's handset. And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. an audience looking for something to play on their handset includes commuters wanting something to fill commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home's time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can can. Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and Bejewelled. There are also versions of titles, such as Colin McRae Rally, that you typically find on PCs and consoles. There are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £5. What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of games on mobiles thanks to technology known as Wap push. By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that Almost half of all phones can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics. The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. Many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Usually you can get hold of Many titles, particularly racing games's best time and race against a ""ghost"" or ""shadow"" to see if you can beat Many titles, particularly racing games. A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to people, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology. With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing. TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS (DIGITAL BRIDGES) As soon as I start playing The game I remember why I never play driving games - because I'm rubbish at driving games. No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. Winning gives you cash for upgrades. Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play. FATAL FORCE (MACROSPACE) A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth. Graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. Both background music and sounds effects work well. The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders. Weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. With the right power-up you can go into a Matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range. Online The game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps.",technologie

High-profile web portals such as Google, Yahoo, Ebay and Amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. So many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC)'s specially created website. An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways, meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. its specially created website has so far received almost £8 million, with more than 11,000 donations being made online every hour. Telco BT stepped in to take over the secure payments on its specially created website and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after its specially created website was initially crippled with online donations. Telco BT has also provided space in London's BT tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations. Some of Web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying Some of the web's biggest firms's homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. On Google's famously sparse homepage Google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. Among the 17 organisations listed are Oxfam, Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) and Network for Good. Many of the sites that Google lists are also taking online donations.

The Auction Drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras, computers and other gadgets people no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. Sadly, the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. Anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to Anti-fraud organisations rather than make donations via aid agencies. Those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies.",technologie
technologie_97,"Mobiles rack up 20 years of use Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating Mobile phones in the UK's 20th anniversary this weekend. the UK's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since 1 January 1985, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use many people's handset as many people's only phone and rarely use a landline. The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while people walked. Britain's first mobile phone call was made from St Katherine's dock to Vodafone's head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched Cellnet (now O2)'s service. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched phones were the size of a briefcase, cost about £2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes. ""Despite that phones were hugely popular in the mid-80s,"" Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone said. ""phones became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" This was also despite the fact that phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made phones very easy to eavesdrop on. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up Vodafone's first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. ""It's very easy to forget that in 1983 when Vodafone put the bid document in Vodafone were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,"" Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone said. ""Cellnet (now O2) was forecasting half that."" Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK. Cellnet (now O2) and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had Orange's UK launch in 1994. Cellnet and Vodafone operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this technology is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.",technologie

But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say Most blogs have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November. The blogging movement has been building up for many years. Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. ""You could look at the US presidential race as a moment when audiences that transformation a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than audiences have never had before,"" Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society says. ""And blogs were a key part of that transformation."" Among blogs were blogs carrying picture messages, saying ""we are sorry"" for George W Bush's's victory and the responses from George W Bush's's supporters. Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. ""We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,"" Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society told the BBC News website. ""But mainstream media followed the story, mainstream media didn't lead the story."" Some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about The blogging movement, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs. Others, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of the French newspaper Le Monde's content. ""Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. journalism is in transition, as society society itself is in transition,"" says Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society. However, Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. ""The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, The one-to-many road of traditional journalism is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate professional journalists to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,"" says Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society. ""The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't's gone forever."" ""With people now walking around with information devices in people's pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories."" It seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger. But the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on Web easily, is here to stay. ""We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,"" said Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society. ""And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.""",technologie
technologie_99,"Mobile multimedia slow to catch on There is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. Consumers swapping old phones for slinkier, dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004, according to analysts Gartner More than 167 million handsets were sold globally between July and September 2004, a period that, according to Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi is ""seldom strong"". But although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps, sounds and video clips few, so far, are taking the chance to do so. In fact, the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing. Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003. This is despite the fact that, during the same period, the numbers of camera phones in the UK more than doubled to 7.5 million. Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. The problem mobile phone users face, said Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using people's funky handsets. ""Also,"" Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind said, ""mobile phone users have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding the interface."" Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because people do not know how to. According to Continental Research, 29% of the people Continental Research questioned said 29% of the people it questioned were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. Only 11% regarded Only 11% as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's's reluctance to start sending multimedia services, said Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind. ""people's ask people's: 'If people's'm streaming video from one handset to another will it work?'"" Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind said. ""There's a lot of user apprehension about that."" There are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as multimedia messages might. Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. ""The rate messaging firm Mblox can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant,"" Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said. The reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users. No-one wants to take the risk of swamping the second generation networks that currently have the most users so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox,. This has led to operators finding other technologies, particularly one known as Wap-push, to get multimedia to operators's customers. But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to networks's customers, the results can be dramatic. Israeli technology firm Celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. One of the first firms to use the Israeli technology firm Celltick service is Hutch India, the largest mobile firm in the country. the Celltick service gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. While not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing people's phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. As a result 40% of the subscribers to the Hutch Alive, which uses Israeli technology firm Celltick's broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator. ""Operators really need to start utilising the Celltick service to reach Operators's customers,"" said Yaron Toren, spokesman for Israeli technology firm Celltick. Until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.",technologie
